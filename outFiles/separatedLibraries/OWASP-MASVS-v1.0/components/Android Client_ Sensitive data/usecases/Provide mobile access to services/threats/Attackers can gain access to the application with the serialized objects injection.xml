                            <desc>An adversary attempts to exploit an application by injecting additional, malicious
                                content during its processing of serialized objects. Developers leverage serialization
                                in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or
                                transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover
                                the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an
                                adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization
                                process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code
                                execution.
