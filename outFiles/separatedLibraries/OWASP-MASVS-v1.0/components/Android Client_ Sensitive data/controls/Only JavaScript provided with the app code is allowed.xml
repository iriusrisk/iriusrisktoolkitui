                        <steps>- Produce a JavaScript payload.
                            - Inject it into the file that the app is requesting. The injection could be done either
                            through a MITM attack or by directly modifying the file in case it is stored on external
                            storage. The whole process could be done through Drozer that uses weasel (MWR's advanced
                            exploitation payload) which is able to install a full agent, injecting a limited agent into
                            a running process, or connecting a reverse shell to act as a Remote Access Tool (RAT).
                            - Check that only the JavaScript provided with the app is allowed.
