                    <desc>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the widely accepted standard for symmetric encryption in
                        mobile apps. It's an iterative block cipher that is based on a series of linked mathematical
                        operations. AES performs a variable number of rounds on the input, each of which involve
                        substitution and permutation of the bytes in the input block. Each round uses a 128-bit round
                        key which is derived from the original AES key. As of this writing, no efficient cryptanalytic
                        attacks against AES have been discovered. However, implementation details and configurable
                        parameters such as the block cipher mode leave some margin for error.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        You shall configure AES encryption with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode instead of ECB mode.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        In CBC mode, plaintext blocks are XORed with the previous ciphertext block. This ensures each
                        encrypted block is unique and randomized even if blocks contain the same information. When
                        storing encrypted data, we recommend using a block mode that also protects the integrity of the
                        stored data, such as Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). The latter has the additional benefit that the
                        algorithm is mandatory for each TLSv1.2 implementation, and thus is available on all modern
                        platforms.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
