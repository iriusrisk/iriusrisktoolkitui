                    <desc>Certificate pinning is the process of associating the backend server with a particular X509
                        certificate or public key, instead of accepting any certificate signed by a trusted certificate
                        authority. A mobile app that stores (&amp;quot;pins&amp;quot;) the server certificate or public
                        key will subsequently only establish connections to the known server. Verify that the server
                        certificate is pinned. Pinning can be implemented in multiple ways:&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Including server's certificate in the application bundle and performing verification
                        on each connection. This requires an update mechanism whenever the certificate on the server is
                        updated Limiting certificate issuer to e.g. one entity and bundling the intermediate CA's public
                        key into the application. In this way we limit the attack surface and have a valid certificate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Owning and managing your own PKI. The application would contain the intermediate CA's
                        public key. This avoids updating the application every time you change the certificate on the
                        server, due to e.g. expiration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;Note that using your own CA would cause the certificate to be self-singed.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
