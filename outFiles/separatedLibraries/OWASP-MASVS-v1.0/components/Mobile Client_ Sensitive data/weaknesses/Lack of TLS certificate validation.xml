                    <desc>The software transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication
                        channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
                        Many communication channels can be "sniffed" by attackers during data transmission. For example,
                        network traffic can often be sniffed by any attacker who has access to a network interface. This
                        significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by attackers.
