                            <desc>Application components, libraries, modules, frameworks, platform, and operating
                                systems could suffer from known vulnerabilities. There is a high risk that an attacker
                                could easily gain access to the underlying systems or data by exploiting these
                                vulnerabilities.

                                In some cases, public exploits exist, making the exploitation process even easier.
