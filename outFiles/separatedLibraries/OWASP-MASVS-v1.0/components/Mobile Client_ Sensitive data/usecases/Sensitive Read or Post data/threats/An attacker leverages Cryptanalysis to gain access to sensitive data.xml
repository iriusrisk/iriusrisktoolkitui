                            <desc>Cryptanalysis is the process of finding weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms and
                                using these weaknesses to decipher the ciphertext without knowing the secret key
                                (instance deduction). Sometimes the weakness is not in the cryptographic algorithm
                                itself, but rather in how it is applied that makes cryptanalysis successful. An attacker
                                may have other goals as well, such as:
                                The goal of the attacker performing cryptanalysis will depend on the specific needs of
                                the attacker in a given attack context. In most cases, if cryptanalysis is successful at
                                all, an attacker will not be able to go past being able to deduce some information about
                                the plaintext (goal 3). However, that may be sufficient for an attacker, depending on
                                the context.
