<threat ref="CAPEC-112" name="An attacker uses Brute Force to gain access to sensitive data" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>In this attack, some asset (information, functionality, identity, etc.) is protected
                                by a finite secret value. The attacker attempts to gain access to this asset by using
                                trial-and-error to exhaustively explore all the possible secret values in the hope of
                                finding the secret (or a value that is functionally equivalent) that will unlock the
                                asset. Examples of secrets can include, but are not limited to, passwords, encryption
                                keys, database lookup keys, and initial values to one-way functions.
                                The key factor in this attack is the attackers' ability to explore the possible secret
                                space rapidly. This, in turn, is a function of the size of the secret space and the
                                computational power the attacker is able to bring to bear on the problem. If the
                                attacker has modest resources and the secret space is large, the challenge facing the
                                attacker is intractable. While the defender cannot control the resources available to an
                                attacker, they can control the size of the secret space. Creating a large secret space
                                involves selecting one's secret from as large a field of equally likely alternative
                                secrets as possible and ensuring that an attacker is unable to reduce the size of this
                                field using available clues or cryptanalysis. Doing this is more difficult than it
                                sounds since elimination of patterns (which, in turn, would provide an attacker clues
                                that would help them reduce the space of potential secrets) is difficult to do using
                                deterministic machines, such as computers. Assuming a finite secret space, a brute force
                                attack will eventually succeed. The defender must rely on making sure that the time and
                                resources necessary to do so will exceed the value of the information. For example, a
                                secret space that will likely take hundreds of years to explore is likely safe from
                                raw-brute force attacks.
