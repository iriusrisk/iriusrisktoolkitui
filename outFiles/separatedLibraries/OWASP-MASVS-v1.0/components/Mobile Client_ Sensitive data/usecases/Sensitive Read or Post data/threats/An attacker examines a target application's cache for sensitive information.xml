                            <desc>An attacker examines a target application's cache for sensitive information. Many
                                applications that communicate with remote entities or which perform intensive
                                calculations utilize caches to improve efficiency. However, if the application computes
                                or receives sensitive information and the cache is not appropriately protected, an
                                attacker can browse the cache and retrieve this information. This can result in the
                                disclosure of sensitive information.
