                    <desc>Applications storing or caching data locally are at risk of attack and compromise of that data. Most mobile devices and operating systems offer built in API's to store data in their encrypted stores, such as the Keychain on iOS.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;div&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Data stored in shared memory, such as a removable SD card, may be accessed by other applications on the device, or may be removed and accessed in a third party system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Do not store sensitive or private data on shared or removable storage, such as SD cards. Where data is stored on shared but non removable storage, there is still a risk an attacker with physical access may be able to access the device storage and therefore the data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Use OS provided secure storage for sensitive or private data.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;</desc>
