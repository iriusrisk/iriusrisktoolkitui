<control ref="MASVS-3.1" name="Do not hard-code encryption keys when using symmetric encryption" platform="" cost="1" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>The security of symmetric encryption and keyed hashes (MACs) depends on the secrecy of the key. If the key is disclosed, the security gained by encryption is lost. To prevent this, never store secret keys in the same place as the encrypted data they helped create. Developers often make the mistake of encrypting locally stored data with a static, hard-coded encryption key and compiling that key into the app. This makes the key accessible to anyone who can use a disassembler. Ensure that no keys or passwords are stored within the source code.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;div&gt; 
 &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
  Note that hard-coded keys are problematic even if the source code is obfuscated since obfuscation is easily bypassed by dynamic instrumentation. If the app is using two-way SSL (both server and client certificates are validated), make sure that:&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;The password to the client certificate isn't stored locally or is locked in the device Keychain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;The client certificate isn't shared among all installations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;If the app relies on additional encrypted containers stored in app data, check how the encryption key is used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;If a key-wrapping scheme is used, ensure that the master secret is initialized for each user or the container is re-encrypted with new key.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;If you can use the master secret or previous password to decrypt the container, check how password changes are handled.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;</desc>
