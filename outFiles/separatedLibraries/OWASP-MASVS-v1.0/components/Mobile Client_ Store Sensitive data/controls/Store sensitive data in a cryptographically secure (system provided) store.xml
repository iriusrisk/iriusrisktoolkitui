<control ref="CWE-312-ENCRYPT" name="Store sensitive data in a cryptographically secure (system provided) store" platform="" cost="1" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>Applications storing or caching data locally are at risk of attack and compromise of that data. Most mobile devices and operating systems offer built in API's to store data in their encrypted stores, such as the Keychain on iOS. These stores are ultimately encrypted using a key derived from the device passcode and require the user to set a passcode.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;div&gt; 
 &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
  However, they do not enforce the quality of the passcode, nor is it possible to determine the quality of the passcode (and therefore, ultimately the key) from within the application.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Data should not be stored locally unless there is an explicit requirement to do so. This includes restricting thumbnails or screenshots of pages in the application that contain private data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Data that must be stored on the client side must be held in a cryptographically secure store.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Use OS provided stores to protect private data on the client side, acknowledging that the residual risk from users with weak passwords may affect that data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Do not store highly sensitive/financial data on the client-side without implementing a provably strong cryptographic process. For example, it should be encrypted using a key derived from an independent password where the strength of this password can be verified.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;</desc>

                            &lt;li&gt;Check the storage routines and verify they are using OS APIs which are built on
                            top of secure storage components.&lt;/li&gt;
