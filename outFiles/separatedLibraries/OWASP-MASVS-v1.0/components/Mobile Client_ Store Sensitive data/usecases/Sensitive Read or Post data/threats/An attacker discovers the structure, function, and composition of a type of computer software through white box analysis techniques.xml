<threat ref="CAPEC-167" name="An attacker discovers the structure, function, and composition of a type of computer software through white box analysis techniques" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>An attacker could retrieve sensitive data stored on a mobile device. This information may be stored in configuration files, embedded within the application itself, or stored in other ways. Sensitive information may include long-term keys, passwords, credit card or financial information, and other private material that the mobile app uses in its interactions with the server. In some cases, it may not even be necessary to gain access to another user's installation - if all instances of the client software are embedded with the same sensitive information (for example, long term keys for communication with the server) then the attacker must simply find a way to gain their own copy of the client software in order to perform this attack.</desc>
