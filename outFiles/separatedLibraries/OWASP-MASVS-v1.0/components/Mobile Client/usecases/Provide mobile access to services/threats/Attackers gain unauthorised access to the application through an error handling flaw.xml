                            <desc>Errors and error handling represent a class of API. Errors related to error handling
                                are so common that they deserve a special kingdom of their own. As with "API
                                Abuse", there are two ways to introduce an error-related security vulnerability: the most common one is handling errors poorly (or not at all). The second is producing errors that
                                either give out too much information (to possible attackers) or are difficult to handle.
