                    <desc>Errors and error handling represent a class of API. Errors related to error handling are so
                        common that they deserve a special kingdom of their own. As with "API Abuse", there
                        are two ways to introduce an error-related security vulnerability: the most common one is handling errors poorly (or not at all). The second is producing errors that either give out too much information (to possible attackers) or are difficult to handle
