                    <desc>The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it
                        is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. Cross-site
                        scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
                        &lt;ol&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted
                        data.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing
                        content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes,
                        mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious
                        script that was injected using the untrusted data.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's
                        web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which
                        states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a
                        different domain.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ol&gt;There are three main kinds of XSS:
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                        &lt;blockquote&gt;
                        The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response.
                        Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a
                        vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web
                        browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a
                        parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed
                        in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a
                        victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's
                        content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
                        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                        &lt;blockquote&gt;
                        The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other
                        trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the
                        application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place
                        to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly
                        interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or
                        interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes
                        malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the
                        user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might
                        inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views
                        the logs.
                        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Type 0: DOM-Based XSS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                        &lt;blockquote&gt;
                        In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types,
                        the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted
                        script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form
                        before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then
                        injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is
                        possible.Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious
                        activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include
                        session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send
                        malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to
                        the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could
                        be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the
                        attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit
                        a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes
                        referred to as &amp;quot;drive-by hacking&amp;quot;.
                        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
                        &lt;blockquote&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;/blockquote&gt;In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware
                        of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the
                        malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less
                        suspicious.
