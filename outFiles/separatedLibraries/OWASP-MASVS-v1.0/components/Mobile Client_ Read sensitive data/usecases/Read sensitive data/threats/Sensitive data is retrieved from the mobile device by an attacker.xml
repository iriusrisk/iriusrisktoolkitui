                            <desc>An attacker with access to the mobile device could inspect the cache to find sensitive
                                data.

                                Many applications that communicate with remote entities or which perform intensive
                                calculations utilize caches to improve efficiency. However, if the application computes
                                or receives sensitive information and the cache is not appropriately protected, an
                                attacker can browse the cache and retrieve this information. This can result in the
                                disclosure of sensitive information.

                                iOS in particular caches the active screen when an app is put into the background. This
                                screenshots is then stored on the file system.
