                    <desc>The software does not fully clear previously used information in a data structure, file, or
                        other resource, before making that resource available to a party in another control sphere.

                        This typically results from new data that is not as long as the old data, which leaves portions
                        of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the
                        length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared
                        after use, it may allow unintended actors to read the data when the memory is reallocated.
