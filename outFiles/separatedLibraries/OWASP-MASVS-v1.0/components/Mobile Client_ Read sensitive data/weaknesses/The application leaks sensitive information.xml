                    <desc>Information leakage is an application weakness in which an application reveals sensitive data,
                        such as technical details of the web application, environment, or user-specific data. Sensitive
                        data may be used by an attacker to exploit the target web application, its hosting network, or
                        its users. Therefore, leakage of sensitive data should be limited or prevented whenever
                        possible. Information leakage, in its most common form, is the result of one or more of the
                        following conditions: A failure to scrub out HTML/Script comments containing sensitive
                        information, improper application or server configurations, or differences in page responses for
                        valid versus invalid data.
