                    <desc>Applications storing or caching data locally are at risk of attack and compromise of that
                        data. Most mobile devices and operating systems offer built in API's to store data in their
                        encrypted stores, such as the Keychain on iOS. Data stored in shared memory, such as a removable
                        SD card, may be accessed by other applications on the device, or may be removed and accessed in
                        a third party system.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        Do not store sensitive or private data on shared or removable storage, such as SD cards. Where
                        data is stored on shared but non removable storage, there is still a risk an attacker with
                        physical access may be able to access the device storage and therefore the data.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        Use OS provided secure storage for sensitive or private data.
                        &lt;/div&gt;

                            &lt;li&gt;Identify in which points the component is processing sensitive data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Check for the sensitiveness of this data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Check if this data is being stored at some point. This data should be kept to the
                            minimum set of data possible for the application to run appropriately and should be stored
                            on OS provided secure-means (i.e. iOS keychain).&lt;/li&gt;
