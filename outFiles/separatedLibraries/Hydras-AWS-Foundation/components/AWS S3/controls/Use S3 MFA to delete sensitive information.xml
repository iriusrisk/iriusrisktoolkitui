          <desc>Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale
                        computing easier for developers.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve
                        any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the
                        same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses
                        to run its own global network of web sites.
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;To add an extra layer of security to data stored within S3 the account owner (root)
                        can enable MFA Delete which means that buckets and the objects within them can only be deleted
                        with the use of Multi-factor authentication device. It is recommended to enable MFA Delete on
                        any buckets containing sensitive data to protect against accidental deletion
                        &lt;br /&gt;Remediation
                        &lt;br /&gt;1. aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket --versioning-configuration
                        Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled

                            If you don't see &amp;quot;MFADelete&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Enabled&amp;quot; then your bucket
                            has no MFA delete enabled.
