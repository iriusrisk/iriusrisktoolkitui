          <desc>	&lt;p&gt;This implementation specification requires covered entities to identify their software applications (data applications that store, maintain or transmit EPHI) and determine how important each is to patient care or business needs, in order to prioritize for data backup, disaster recovery and/or emergency operations plans. A prioritized list of specific applications and data will help determine which applications or information systems get restored first and/or which must be available at all times.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
