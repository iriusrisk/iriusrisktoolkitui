          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Implement or update policies and procedures that specify the proper functions to be performed, the manner in which those functions are to be performed, and the physical attributes of the surroundings of a specific workstation or class of workstation that can access electronic protected health information.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; The Workstation Use standard also applies to covered entities with workforce members that work off site using workstations that can access EPHI. This includes employees who work from home, in satellite offices, or in another facility. Workstation policies and procedures must specify the proper functions to be performed, regardless of where the workstation is located.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Some common practices that may already be in place include logging off before leaving a workstation for an extended period time, and using and continually updating antivirus software.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
