          <desc>&lt;p&gt;The Other Arrangements implementation specifications provide that when a covered entity and its business associate are both government entities, the covered entity may comply with the standard in either of two alternative ways:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; If it enters into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the business associate and the MOU contains terms which accomplish the objectives of the Business Associate Contracts section of the Security Rule.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;If other law (including regulations adopted by the covered entity or its business associate) contain requirements applicable to the business associate that accomplish the objectives of the business associate contract. If statutory obligations of the covered entity or its business associate do not permit the covered entity to include in its other arrangements authorization of the termination of the contract by the covered entity, the termination authorization may be omitted.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; This implementation specification also applies to certain situations in which other laws require a business associate to perform certain functions or activities on behalf of the covered entity or provide certain services to the covered entity.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
