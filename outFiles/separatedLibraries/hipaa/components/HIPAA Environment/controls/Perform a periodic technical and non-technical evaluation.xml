          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Perform a periodic technical and non-technical evaluation, based initially upon the standards implemented under this rule and subsequently, in response to environmental or operations changes affecting the security of&amp;nbsp;electronic protected health information, that establishes the extent to which an entity's security policies and procedures meet the requirements of this subpart [the Security Rule].&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the evaluation is to establish a process for covered entities to review and maintain reasonable and appropriate security measures to comply with the Security Rule. Initially the evaluation must be based on the security standards implemented to comply with the Security Rule.

The on-going evaluation should also be performed on a scheduled basis, such as annually or every two years. The evaluation must include reviews of the technical and non-technical aspects of the security program.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
