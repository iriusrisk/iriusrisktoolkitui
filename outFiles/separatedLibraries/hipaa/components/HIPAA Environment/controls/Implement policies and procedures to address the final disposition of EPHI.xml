          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Implement policies and procedures to address the final disposition (disposal) of electronic protected health information, and/or the hardware or electronic media on which it is stored.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; When covered entities dispose of any electronic media that contain EPHI they should make sure it is unusable and/or inaccessible. One way to dispose of electronic media is by degaussing. Degaussing is a method whereby a strong magnetic field is applied to magnetic media to fully erase the data. If a covered entity does not have access to degaussing equipment, another way to dispose of the electronic media is to physically damage it beyond repair, making the data inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
