          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Implement procedures for terminating access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) when the employment of a workforce member ends or an employee's job description changes to require more or less access to EPHI.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Termination procedures must be implemented to remove access privileges when an employee, contractor, or other individual previously entitled to access information no longer has these privileges. Whether the employee leaves the organization voluntarily or involuntarily, procedures to terminate access must be in place.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; The same process that is implemented for termination should also be used to change access levels if an employee's job description changes to require more or less access to EPHI. The procedures should also address the complexity of the organization and the sophistication of associated information systems.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
