          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Implement procedures to control and validate a person's access based on their role or function, including visitor control, and control of access to software programs for testing and revision.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; The purpose of this implementation specification is to align a person's access to information with his or her role or function in the organization. These functional or role-based access control and validation procedures should be closely aligned with the facility security plan. These procedures are the means by which a covered entity will actually determine the workforce members or persons that should have access to certain locations within the facility based on their role or function.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
