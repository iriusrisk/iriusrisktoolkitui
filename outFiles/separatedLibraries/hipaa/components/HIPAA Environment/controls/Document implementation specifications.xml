          <desc>&lt;p&gt;The documents of the group health plan shall be documented and incorporate provisions to require the&lt;br /&gt; plan sponsor to:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the electronic protected health information that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits on behalf of the group health plan.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Ensure that the adequate separation required is supported by reasonable and appropriate security measures.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Ensure that any agent, including a subcontractor, to whom it provides this information agrees to implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the information; and (iv) Report to the group health plan any security incident of which it becomes aware.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; In other words, the Security Rule generally requires that if the plan sponsor of a group health plan has access to EPHI beyond summary information and enrollment information or to EPHI other than that which has been authorized under &amp;sect;164.508, the plan documents must contain language similar to that already required by the Privacy Rule.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
