          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Create a retrievable, exact copy of electronic protected health information, when needed, before movement of equipment.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This specification protects the availability of EPHI and is similar to the Data Backup Plan implementation specification for the contingency plan standard of the Administrative Safeguards, which requires covered entities to implement procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of EPHI. Therefore, both implementation specifications may be included in the same policies and procedures. A covered entity may choose to backup a hard drive before moving to prevent loss of EPHI when the existing data backup plan does not provide for local hard drive backups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another option may be to limit where computer users store their files. For example, larger organizations may implement policies that require users to save all information on the network, thus eliminating the need for a hard drive back up prior to the move. Either of these options, and others, may be considered reasonable and appropriate solutions, depending on the covered entityâ€™s environment.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
