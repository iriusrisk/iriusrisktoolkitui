          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Establish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information during an emergency.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These procedures are documented instructions and operational practices for obtaining access to necessary EPHI during an emergency situation. Access controls are necessary under emergency conditions, although they may be vary different from those used in normal operational circumstances. Covered entities should determine the types of situations that would require emergency access to an information system or application that contains EPHI.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Procedures must be established beforehand to instruct workforce members on possible ways to gain access to needed EPHI in, for example, a situation in which normal environmental systems, such as electrical power, have been severely damaged or rendered inoperative due to a natural or man made disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
