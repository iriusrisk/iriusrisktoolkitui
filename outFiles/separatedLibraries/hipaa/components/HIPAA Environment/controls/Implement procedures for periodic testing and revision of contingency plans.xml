          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Implement procedures for periodic testing and revision of contingency plans.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is important to point out that this implementation specification applies to all implementation specifications under the Contingency Plan standard, including the Data Backup Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, and Emergency Mode Operations Plan.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Disaster recovery and emergency mode operations plans might be tested by using a scenario-based walkthrough (to avoid daily operations impacts) or by performing complete live tests. The comprehensiveness and sophistication of the testing and revision procedures depends on the complexity of the covered entity's organization and other factors such as size and costs. It is expected that the frequency and comprehensiveness of the procedures will vary among covered entities.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
