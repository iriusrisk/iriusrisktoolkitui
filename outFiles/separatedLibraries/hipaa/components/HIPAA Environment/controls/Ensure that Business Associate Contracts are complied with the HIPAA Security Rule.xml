          <desc>&lt;p&gt;The Business Associate Contracts implementation specifications state that a business associate contract must provide that the business associate will:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the electronic protected health. information that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits on behalf of the covered entity ...&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Ensure that any agent, including a subcontractor, to whom it provides such information agrees to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect it.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Report to the covered entity any security incident of which it becomes aware.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Authorize termination of the contract by the covered entity, if the covered entity determines that the business associate has violated a material term of the contract.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Covered entities may already have business associate contracts in place in order to comply with the Privacy Rule. If the business associate creates, receives, maintains, or transmits EPHI, these existing contracts should be reviewed and modified in order to meet the Security Rule Business Associate Contracts requirements. Alternatively, covered entities could have two separate contracts to address the requirements of the Privacy and Security Rules respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
