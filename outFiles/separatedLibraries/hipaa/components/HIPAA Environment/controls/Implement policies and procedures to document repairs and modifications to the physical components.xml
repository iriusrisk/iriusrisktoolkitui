          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Implement policies and procedures to document repairs and modifications to the physical components that are related to security (for example, hardware, walls, doors and locks).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; In a small office, documentation may be a single logbook that notes the date, reason for repair, or modification and who authorized it. In a large organization, various repairs and modifications of physical security components may need to be documented in more detail and maintained in a database.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; In some covered entities the most frequent physical security changes may be re-keying doors or locks, or changing the combination on a door, when someone from the workforce has been terminated. Some facilities may use door locks that rely on a card or badge reader. Documentation on the repair, addition, or removal of these devices may also be needed to meet this specification.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
