          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Malicious software can be thought of as any program that harms information systems, such as: viruses, Trojan horses or worms. As a result of an unauthorized infiltration, EPHI and other data can be damaged or destroyed, or at minimum, require expensive and time-consuming repairs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To solve this risk, implement procedures for guarding against, detecting and reporting, found malicious software in our systems. All workforce members must be regularly trained and reminded about this process.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
