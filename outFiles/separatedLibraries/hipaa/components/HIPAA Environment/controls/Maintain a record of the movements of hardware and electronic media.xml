          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Maintain a record of the movements of hardware and electronic media and any person responsible for the same.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since this is an addressable specification, each covered entity must determine if and how it should be implemented for their organization. If a covered entity's hardware and media containing EPHI are moved from one location to another, a record should be maintained as documentation of the move.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Portable workstations and media present a special accountability challenge. Portable technology is getting smaller, less expensive, and has an increased capacity to store large quantities of data. As a result, it is becoming more prevalent in the health care industry, making accountability even more important and challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
