<threat ref="CAPEC-16" name="Dictionary-based or brute force password attack" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>An attacker tries each of the words in a dictionary as passwords to gain access to
                                the system via some user's account. If the password chosen by the user was a word
                                within the dictionary, this attack will be successful (in the absence of other
                                mitigations). This is a specific instance of the password brute forcing attack
                                pattern.&lt;/br&gt;
