<threat ref="CAPEC-115-SECRETQ" name="Attackers bypass authentication by guessing the answers to secret questions" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>The answers to secret questions that only the user should know can often be found
                                through social networking and other online resources. For example: Date of birth,
                                mother's maiden name, first school attended, etc. They can all readily be found online.
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;In many the attacker may not have to find the exact answer, but can simply
                                infer a reduced list of potential answers which they can use in an automated attack on
                                the system. For example, if they know the town where the user was born then they could
                                use a list of all the schools in that town to brute force the first school attended.
                                &lt;/div&gt;
