                            <desc>An attacker examines an available client application for the presence of sensitive
                                information.&amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                This information may be stored in configuration files, embedded within the application
                                itself, or stored in other ways. Sensitive information may include long-term keys,
                                passwords, credit card or financial information, and other private material that the
                                client uses in its interactions with the server.&amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                While servers are (hopefully) protected with professional security administrators, most
                                users may be less skilled at protecting their clients. As a result, the user client may
                                represent a weak link that an attacker can exploit. If an attacker can gain access to a
                                client installation, they may be able to detect and lift sensitive information that
                                could be used directly (such as financial information), or allow the attacker to subvert
                                future communication between the client and the server.&amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                In some cases, it may not even be necessary to gain access to another user's
                                installation - if all instances of the client software are embedded with the same
                                sensitive information (for example, long term keys for communication with the server),
                                then the attacker must simply find a way to gain their own copy of the client in order
                                to perform this attack.
                                &lt;br /&gt;
