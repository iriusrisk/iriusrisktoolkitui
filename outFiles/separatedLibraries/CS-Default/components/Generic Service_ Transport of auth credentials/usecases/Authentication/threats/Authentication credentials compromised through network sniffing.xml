                            <desc>An attacker with access to the network path between the user and the server could use
                                network sniffing to read clear text data traversing the network.
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;The networks used by users are the most likely points of attack since these
                                are often shared by many other users, e.g. corporate networks or are public and
                                untrusted such as public WiFi access points.
                                &lt;/div&gt;
