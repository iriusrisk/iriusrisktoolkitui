                            <desc>An attacker can craft special user-controllable input consisting of XPath expressions
                                to inject the XML database and bypass authentication or glean information that he
                                normally would not be able to.&amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;div&gt;

                                XPath Injection enables an attacker to talk directly to the XML database, thus bypassing
                                the application completely. XPath Injection results from the failure of an application
                                to properly sanitize input used as part of dynamic XPath expressions used to query an
                                XML database.&amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
