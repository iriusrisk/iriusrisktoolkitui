<threat ref="CWE-937" name="Attackers gain unauthorised access to data or services by exploiting weaknesses in third party libraries" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>Applications typically make extensive use of 3rd party libraries to provide common
                                functions. Attackers could target vulnerabilities in these libraries in order to gain
                                unauthorized access to data or services.&amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                Since the use of particular libraries and even versions of those libraries can often be
                                determined remotely, attackers can sometimes employ automated scanning tools to identify
                                vulnerable software. This increases the likelihood of attack.
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
