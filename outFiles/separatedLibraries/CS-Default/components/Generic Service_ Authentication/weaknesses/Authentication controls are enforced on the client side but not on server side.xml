                    <desc>Open authenticated endpoints that rely on authentication performed by a client are easily
                        identifiable and exploitable by accessing them directly. Clients can be subverted as an attacker
                        usually has full control over them so they have to be treated as an untrusted component.

                        &amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;A client/server product that performs authentication within client code but not in
                        server code, allows server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits
                        the authentication check. client-side authentication is extremely weak and may be breached
                        easily. Any attacker may read the source code and reverse-engineer the authentication mechanism
                        to access parts of the application which would otherwise be protected.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
