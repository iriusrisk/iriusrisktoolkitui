                    <desc>When the product encounters an error condition or failure, its design requires it to fall back
                        to a state that is less secure than other options that are available, such as selecting the
                        weakest encryption algorithm or using the most permissive access control restrictions.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;By entering a less secure state, the product inherits the weaknesses associated with
                        that state, making it easier to compromise. At the least, it causes administrators to have a
                        false sense of security. This weakness typically occurs as a result of wanting to &amp;quot;fail
                        functional&amp;quot; to minimize administration and support costs, instead of &amp;quot;failing
                        safe.&amp;quot;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
