                            <desc>An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to
                                redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious
                                site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.
                                Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing
                                attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.
