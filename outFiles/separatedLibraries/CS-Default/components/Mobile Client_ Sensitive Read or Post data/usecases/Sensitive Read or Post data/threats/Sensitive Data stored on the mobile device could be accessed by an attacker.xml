                            <desc>An attacker could retrieve sensitive data stored on a mobile device.
                                &lt;br /&gt;This information may be stored in configuration files, embedded within the
                                application itself, or stored in other ways. Sensitive information may include long-term
                                keys, passwords, credit card or financial information, and other private material that
                                the mobile app uses in its interactions with the server.&amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;br /&gt;In some cases, it may not even be necessary to gain access to another user's
                                installation - if all instances of the client software are embedded with the same
                                sensitive information (for example, long term keys for communication with the server)
                                then the attacker must simply find a way to gain their own copy of the client in order
                                to perform this attack.
