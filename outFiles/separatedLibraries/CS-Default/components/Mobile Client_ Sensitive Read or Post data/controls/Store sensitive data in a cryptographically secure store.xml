<control ref="CWE-312-ENCRYPT" name="Store sensitive data in a cryptographically secure store" platform="" cost="2" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>Mobile devices offer built in API's to store data in their encrypted stores,
                        such as the keychain on iOS. These stores are ultimately encrypted using a key
                        derived from the device passcode and require the user to set a passcode. &amp;nbsp;However,
                        they do not enforce the quality of the passcode, nor is it possible to determine
                        the quality of the passcode (and therefore, ultimately the key) from within the
                        application.&amp;nbsp;Storing data in the built in encrypted store is therefore
                        recommended for private data, but not for highly sensitive financial data for
                        example. &amp;nbsp;If storing highly sensitive data is a requirement, then it
                        should be encrypted using a key derived from an independent password where the
                        strength of this password can be verified.

                            &lt;li&gt;Check the storage routines and verify they are using OS APIs which are built on
