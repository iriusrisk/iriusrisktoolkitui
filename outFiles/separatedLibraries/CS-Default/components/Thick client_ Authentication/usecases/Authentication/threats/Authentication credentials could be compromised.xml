                            <desc>If authentication credentials not adequately protected in the client, then they could
                                be compromised through a number of attack vectors. If the credentials are hard coded
                                into the source, then everyone with access to the source, will also have access to the
                                credentials. This could include internal and third party developers.&amp;nbsp;

                                &amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;br /&gt;If the credentials are stored on the file system without adequate operation
                                system controls, then system administrators with access to the server would also have
                                access to the credentials.
                                &lt;/div&gt;
