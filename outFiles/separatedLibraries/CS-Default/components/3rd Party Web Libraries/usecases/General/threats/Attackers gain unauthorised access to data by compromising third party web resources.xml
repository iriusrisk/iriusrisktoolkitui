                            <desc>Web applications typically make extensive use of 3rd party web resources such as
                                JavaScript and CSS files.&amp;nbsp; Should attackers gain access to the source code
                                repositories, or even Content Delivery Networks that host these libraries, then they
                                could gain access to applications that use this content.
