                            <desc>Users lose trust in the system because a key security mechanism, such as certificate
                                validation is not present and visible.&amp;nbsp; For example, should a TLS certificate
                                expire or become invalid then this is clearly displayed in the browser as a security
                                warning.&amp;nbsp; This could cause users to abandon the system.
