                            <desc>An attacker crafts malicious web links and distributes them (via web pages, email,
                                etc.), typically in a targeted manner, hoping to induce users to click on the link and
                                execute the malicious action against some third-party application. If successful, the
                                action embedded in the malicious link will be processed and accepted by the targeted
                                application with the users' privilege level.
                                &lt;br /&gt;This type of attack leverages the persistence and implicit trust placed in
                                user session cookies by many web applications today. In such an architecture, once the
                                user authenticates to an application and a session cookie is created on the user's
                                system, all following transactions for that session are authenticated using that cookie
                                including potential actions initiated by an attacker and simply &amp;quot;riding&amp;quot;
                                the existing session cookie.
