                            <desc>Attackers could cause users to perform actions by exploiting Cross Site Request
                                Forgery vulnerabilities. This involves the attackers creating a malicious website that
                                hosts a form or JavaScript designed to perform a POST or GET request against the target
                                application. If the victim is logged into the target application, and then navigates to
                                the attacker's malicious website, the form will be submitted and the operation performed
                                by &amp;quot;riding&amp;quot; on the users existing session.
