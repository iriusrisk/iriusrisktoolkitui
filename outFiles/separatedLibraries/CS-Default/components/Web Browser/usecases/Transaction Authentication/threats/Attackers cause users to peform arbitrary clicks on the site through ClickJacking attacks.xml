                            <desc>In a clickjacking attack the victim is tricked into unknowingly initiating some action
                                in one system while interacting with the UI from seemingly completely different system.&amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                While being logged in to some target system, the victim visits the attackers' malicious
                                site which displays a UI that the victim wishes to interact with. In reality, the
                                clickjacked page has a transparent layer above the visible UI with action controls that
                                the attacker wishes the victim to execute. The victim clicks on buttons or other UI
                                elements they see on the page which actually triggers the action controls in the
                                transparent overlaying layer.
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                Depending on what that action control is, the attacker may have just tricked the victim
                                into executing some potentially privileged (and most certainly undesired) functionality
                                in the target system to which the victim is authenticated.&amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                The basic problem here is that there is a dichotomy between what the victim thinks he's
                                clicking on versus what he or she is actually clicking on.
                                &lt;br /&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
