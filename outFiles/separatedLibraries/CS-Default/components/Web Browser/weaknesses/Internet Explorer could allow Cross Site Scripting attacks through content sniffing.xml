                    <desc>The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient
                        defense against directed attacks against the product. This weakness covers three distinct
                        situations:
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;A &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; protection mechanism occurs when the application does
                        not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;An &amp;quot;insufficient&amp;quot; protection mechanism might provide some defenses -
                        for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that
                        is intended.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Finally, an &amp;quot;ignored&amp;quot; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available
                        and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
