                        &lt;br /&gt;When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any
                        mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an
                        attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be
                        treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc.
                        and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.
