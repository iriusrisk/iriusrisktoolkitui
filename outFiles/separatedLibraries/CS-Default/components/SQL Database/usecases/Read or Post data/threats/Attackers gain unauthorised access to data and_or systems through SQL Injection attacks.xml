                            <desc>Successful SQL Injection attacks could lead to full compromise of the database or to a
                                partial compromise of only the data visible to the application.
                                &lt;div&gt;

                                Typically, these types of attacks result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data,
                                but can also be used to inject spurious data into the database or to drop tables and
                                deny service to legitimate users.
                                &lt;/div&gt;
