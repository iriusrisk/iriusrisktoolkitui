                    <desc>The application stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be
                        accessible to another control sphere.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Because the information is stored in cleartext, attackers could potentially read it.
                        Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could
                        determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Cache objects are another source of this weakness, an attacker can examine a target
                        application's cache for sensitive information. Many applications that communicate with remote
                        entities or which perform intensive calculations utilize caches to improve efficiency. However,
                        if the application computes or receives sensitive information and the cache is not appropriately
                        protected, an attacker can browse the cache and retrieve this information. This can result in
                        the disclosure of sensitive information.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
