                            <desc>&lt;p&gt;An overly permissive policy file allows many of the same attacks seen in
                                Cross-Site Scripting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;Once the user has visited a malicious site, they are vulnerable to a variety of
                                attacks. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may
                                include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker
                                could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be
                                especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage
                                that site.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware
                                of it.&lt;/p&gt;
