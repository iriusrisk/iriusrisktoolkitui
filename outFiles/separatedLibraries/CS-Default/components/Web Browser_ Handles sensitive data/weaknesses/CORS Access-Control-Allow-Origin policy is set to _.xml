                    <desc>The software uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        A cross-domain policy file (&amp;quot;crossdomain.xml&amp;quot; in Flash and &amp;quot;clientaccesspolicy.xml&amp;quot;
                        in Silverlight) defines a whitelist of domains from which a server is allowed to make
                        cross-domain requests. When making a cross-domain request, the Flash or Silverlight client will
                        first look for the policy file on the target server. If it is found, and the domain hosting the
                        application is explicitly allowed to make requests, the request is made.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        Therefore, if a cross-domain policy file includes domains that should not be trusted, such as
                        when using wildcards, then the application could be attacked by these untrusted domains. An
                        overly permissive policy file allows many of the same attacks seen in Cross-Site Scripting
                        (CWE-79). Once the user has executed a malicious Flash or Silverlight application, they are
                        vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The attacker could transfer private information, such as
                        cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The
                        attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be
                        especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that
                        site.In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
