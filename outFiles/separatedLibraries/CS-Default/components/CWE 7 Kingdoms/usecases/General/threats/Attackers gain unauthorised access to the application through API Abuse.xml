                            <desc>An API is a contract between a caller and a callee. The most common forms of API abuse
                                are caused by the caller failing to honor its end of this contract. For example, if a
                                program fails to call chdir() after calling chroot(), it violates the contract that
                                specifies how to change the active root directory in a secure fashion. Another good
                                example of library abuse is expecting the callee to return trustworthy DNS information
                                to the caller. In this case, the caller abuses the callee API by making certain
                                assumptions about its behavior (that the return value can be used for authentication
                                purposes). One can also violate the caller-callee contract from the other side. For
                                example, if a coder subclasses SecureRandom and returns a non-random value, the contract
                                is violated.&amp;nbsp;
