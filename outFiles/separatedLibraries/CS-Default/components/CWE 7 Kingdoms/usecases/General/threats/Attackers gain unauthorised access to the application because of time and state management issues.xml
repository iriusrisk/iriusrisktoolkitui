                                This weakness is related to the&amp;nbsp;improper&amp;nbsp;management of time and state
                                in an environment that supports simultaneous or near-simultaneous computation by
                                multiple systems, processes, or threads.
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;Distributed computation is about time and state. That is, in order for more
                                than one component to communicate, state must be shared, and all that takes time. Most
                                programmers anthropomorphize their work. They think about one thread of control carrying
                                out the entire program in the same way they would if they had to do the job themselves.
                                Modern computers, however, switch between tasks very quickly, and in multi-core,
                                multi-CPU, or distributed systems, two events may take place at exactly the same time.
                                Defects rush to fill the gap between the programmer's model of how a program executes
                                and what happens in reality. These defects are related to&amp;nbsp;unexpected&amp;nbsp;interactions
                                between threads, processes, time, and information. These interactions happen through
                                shared state: semaphores, variables, the file system, and, basically, anything that can
                                store information.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
