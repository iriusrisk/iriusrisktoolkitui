                            <desc>Input validation and representation problems are caused by metacharacters, alternate
                                encodings and numeric representations. Security problems result from trusting input. The
                                issues include: Buffer Overflows, Cross-Site Scripting attacks, SQL Injection, and many others.&amp;nbsp;
