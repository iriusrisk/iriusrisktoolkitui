                        Failure to enforce proper access and locking of resources can result in race-conditions, where
                        concurrent calls can subvert the security controls or logical flow within an application. For
                        example, in a financial system, parallel threads may simultaneously check an account balance
                        before making a withdrawal to ensure adequate funds are present, before both conduct a
                        transaction and take the account overdrawn.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Verify that controls related to the proper management of time and state in an
                        environment that supports simultaneous or near-simultaneous computation by multiple systems,
                        processes, or threads are properly implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Verify the safeguards in place, and the logical sequence of checking, locking, and
                        transacting are resistant to race-conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;

                            &lt;li&gt;Identify the areas of the application where concurrent access to resources can
                            happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;Verify that unexpected input, timing or action sequence is not causing unexpected
                            behavior on the system.&lt;/li&gt;
