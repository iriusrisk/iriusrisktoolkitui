                    <desc>The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to
                        another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is
                        under user control. The key would typically identify a user related record stored in the system
                        and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an
                        attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization
                        process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user
                        performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence
                        bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system. One manifestation of this
                        weakness would be if a system used sequential or otherwise easily guessable session ids that
                        would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
