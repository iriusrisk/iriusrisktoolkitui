                            <desc>An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target
                                application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing
                                techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the
                                target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to
                                individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a
                                variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is
                                to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also
                                sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing
                                logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the
                                target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive
                                information.
