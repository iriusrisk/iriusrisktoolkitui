                            <desc>An adversary crafts a request to a target that results in the target listing/indexing
                                the content of a directory as output. One common method of triggering directory contents
                                as output is to construct a request containing a path that terminates in a directory
                                name rather than a file name since many applications are configured to provide a list of
                                the directory's contents when such a request is received. An adversary can use this to
                                explore the directory tree on a target as well as learn the names of files. This can
                                often end up revealing test files, backup files, temporary files, hidden files,
                                configuration files, user accounts, script contents, as well as naming conventions, all
                                of which can be used by an attacker to mount additional attacks.
