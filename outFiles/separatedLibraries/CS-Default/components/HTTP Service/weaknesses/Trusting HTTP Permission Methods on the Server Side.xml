                    <desc>The server contains a protection mechanism that assumes that
                        any URI that is accessed using HTTP GET will not cause a state change to the
                        associated resource. This might allow attackers to bypass intended access
                        restrictions and conduct resource modification and deletion attacks, since some
                        applications allow GET to modify state.
