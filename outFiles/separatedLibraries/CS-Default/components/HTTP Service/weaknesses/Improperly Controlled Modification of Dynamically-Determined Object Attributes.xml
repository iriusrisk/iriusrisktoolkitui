                    <desc>The software receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes,
                        properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not
                        properly control which attributes can be modified.&amp;nbsp;

                        &amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;If the object contains attributes that were only intended for internal use, then
                        their unexpected modification could lead to a vulnerability. This weakness is sometimes known by
                        the language-specific mechanisms that make it possible, such as mass assignment, auto-binding, or
                        object injection.+ Applicable Platforms
