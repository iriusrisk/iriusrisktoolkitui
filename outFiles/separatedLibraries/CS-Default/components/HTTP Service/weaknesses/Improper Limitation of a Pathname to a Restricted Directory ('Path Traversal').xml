                    <desc>The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file
                        or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not
                        properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve
                        to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By
                        using special elements such as &amp;quot;..&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; separators,
                        attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are
                        elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the &amp;quot;../&amp;quot;
                        sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the
                        current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as &amp;quot;/usr/local/bin&amp;quot;,
                        which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path
                        traversal.In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow
                        an attacker to truncate a generated filename to widen the scope of attack. For example, the
                        software may add &amp;quot;.txt&amp;quot; to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text
                        files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
