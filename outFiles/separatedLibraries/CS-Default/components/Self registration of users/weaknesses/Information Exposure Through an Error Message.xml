                    <desc>The software generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its
                        environment, users, or associated data.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a
                        password), or it may be useful for launching other, more deadly attacks. If an attack fails, an
                        attacker may use error information provided by the server to launch another more focused attack.
                        For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full
                        pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number
                        of &amp;quot;..&amp;quot; sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL
                        injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed
                        query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information
                        used within the query.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
