                    <desc>The software does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with
                        an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected. The actor
                        could be a human or an automated process such as a virus or bot. This could be used to cause a
                        denial of service, compromise program logic (such as limiting humans to a single vote), or other
                        consequences. For example, an authentication routine might not limit the number of times an
                        attacker can guess a password. Or, a web site might conduct a poll but only expect humans to
                        vote a maximum of once a day.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
