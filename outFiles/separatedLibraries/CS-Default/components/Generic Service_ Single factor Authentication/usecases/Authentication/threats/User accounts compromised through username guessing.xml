<threat ref="CAPEC-112-USERNAME" name="User accounts compromised through username guessing" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>Attackers could perform a brute force attack against the login function by choosing a
                                simple password that users are likely to use for the site, and that meets the site's
                                password policy.
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;br /&gt;Then they could use an automated script to iterate through a list of
                                possible usernames. &amp;nbsp;These could be obtained from a dictionary, or generated
                                through pure brute force means. &amp;nbsp;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;br /&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                This type of attack cannot be defended against using an account lockout policy because
                                each username is only attempted once.
                                &lt;/div&gt;
