                        Users must retain control of their credentials in a single factor system, and to facilitate this
                        they must have the ability to change their password. This is particularly important should the
                        user determine their password has been compromised, potentially allowing a third party to access
                        the system impersonating them. Furthermore, accountability is adversely affected where users
                        cannot change their passwords, as they can plausibly claim that even though they knew their
                        account credentials were compromised, there was no way for them to prevent unauthorized use of
                        the account.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Users should be allowed to change their passwords, ideally within the application&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Password change should require re-authentication to prevent abuse of a compromised or
                        unattended session. I.e. the user should be required to enter their existing password in order
                        to change it.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
