<threat ref="CAPEC-201" name="Attackers access system files through XML related Attacks" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>An attacker creates an XML document that with an external entity reference. External
                                entity references can take the form of tags in a DTD. Because processors may not
                                validate documents with external entities, there may be no checks on the nature of the
                                reference in the external entity. This can allow an attacker to open arbitrary files or
                                connections. For example, the following DTD would attempt to open the /dev/tty device:
                                &lt;br /&gt;
