                            <desc>Third party browser plugins such as Java, Microsoft Silverlight and Adobe Flash
                                increase the attack surface of any application.&amp;nbsp; Vulnerabilities in these
                                plugins can be used by attackers to gain access to a user's browser and in turn to their
                                data and potentially the system itself.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

                                Attackers would typically attack this from malicious websites and would require users to
                                first visit these sites in order for the attack to be launched.
                                &lt;/div&gt;
