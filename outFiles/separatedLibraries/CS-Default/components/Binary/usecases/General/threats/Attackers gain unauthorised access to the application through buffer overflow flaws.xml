                            <desc>Buffer Overflow attacks target improper or missing bounds checking on buffer
                                operations, typically triggered by input injected by an attacker. As a consequence, an
                                attacker is able to write past the boundaries of allocated buffer regions in memory,
                                causing a program crash or potentially redirection of execution as per the attackers'
                                choice.
