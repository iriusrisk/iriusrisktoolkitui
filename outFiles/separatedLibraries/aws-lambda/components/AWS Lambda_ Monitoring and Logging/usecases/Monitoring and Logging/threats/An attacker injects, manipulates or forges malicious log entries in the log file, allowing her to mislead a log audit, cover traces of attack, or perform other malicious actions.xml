<threat ref="CAPEC-93" name="An attacker injects, manipulates or forges malicious log entries in the log file, allowing her to mislead a log audit, cover traces of attack, or perform other malicious actions" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>	&lt;p&gt;This attack targets the log files of the target host. The attacker injects, manipulates or forges malicious log entries in the log file, allowing him to mislead a log audit, cover traces of attack, or perform other malicious actions. The target host is not properly controlling log access. As a result tainted data is resulting in the log files leading to a failure in accountability, non-repudiation and incident forensics capability.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
