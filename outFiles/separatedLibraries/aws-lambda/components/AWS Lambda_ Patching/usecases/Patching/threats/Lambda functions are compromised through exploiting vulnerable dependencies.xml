<threat ref="AWS-LAMBDA-T10" name="Lambda functions are compromised through exploiting vulnerable dependencies" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>	&lt;p&gt;Functions often use third-party libraries or frameworks. These dependencies can be vulnerable and new vulnerabilities are regularly disclosed. As soon as a vulnerability is registered in the CVE database, attackers will try to exploit the vulnerability within hours using automated exploits.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
