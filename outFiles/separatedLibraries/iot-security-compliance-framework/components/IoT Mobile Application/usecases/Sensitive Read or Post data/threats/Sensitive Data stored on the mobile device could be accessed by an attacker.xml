                            <desc>&lt;p&gt;An attacker could retrieve sensitive data stored on a mobile device. This information may be stored in configuration files, embedded within the application itself, or stored in other ways. Sensitive information may include long-term keys, passwords, credit card or financial information, and other private material that the mobile app uses in its interactions with the server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it may not even be necessary to gain access to another user's installation - if all instances of the client software are embedded with the same sensitive information (for example, long term keys for communication with the server) then the attacker must simply find a way to gain their own copy of the client software in order to perform this attack.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
