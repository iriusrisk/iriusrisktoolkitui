                            <desc>	&lt;p&gt;Attackers could use malicious mobile applications to attack legitimate applications that export their components improperly. The attacks and consequences of improperly exporting a component may depend on the exported component: If access to an exported Activity is not restricted, any application will be able to launch the activity. 
 This may allow a malicious application to gain access to sensitive information, modify the internal state of the application, or trick a user into interacting with the victim application whilst believing they are still interacting with the malicious application. If access to an exported Service is not restricted, any application may start and bind to the Service. &lt;/p&gt;

 Depending on the exposed functionality, this may allow a malicious application to perform unauthorized actions, gain access to sensitive information, or corrupt the internal state of the application. If access to a Content Provider is not restricted to only the expected applications, then malicious applications might be able to access the sensitive data. Note that in Android before 4.2, the Content Provider is automatically exported unless it has been explicitly declared as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; exported.</desc>
