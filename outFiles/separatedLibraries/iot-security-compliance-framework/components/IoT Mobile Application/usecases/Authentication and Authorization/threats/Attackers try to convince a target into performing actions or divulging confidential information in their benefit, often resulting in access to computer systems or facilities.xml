<threat ref="CAPEC-403" name="Attackers try to convince a target into performing actions or divulging confidential information in their benefit, often resulting in access to computer systems or facilities" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>&lt;p&gt;Attack patterns within this category focus on the manipulation and exploitation of people. The techniques defined by each pattern are used to convince a target into performing actions or divulging confidential information that benefit the adversary, often resulting in access to computer systems or facilities. While similar to a confidence trick or simple fraud, the term typically applies to trickery or deception for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or computer system access. In most cases, the adversary never comes face-to-face with the victim.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
