                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Devices and services should be designed with security usability in mind, reducing where possible, security friction and decision points that may have a detrimental impact on security. Best practices on usable security should be followed, particularly for user interaction and user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Usability and cybersecurity complement one another. A well-designed system needs to make it easy for the user to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing, and easy to recover when the wrong things happen anyway. Usability has only recently become an important concern in the cybersecurity field, due to growing recognition of the fact that users themselves are a key component in organizational security programs. If users find a cybersecurity measure too difficult, they will try to circumvent it - which harms organizational security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is in every organization's interest to design cybersecurity measures in such a way that they take into account the perceptions, characteristics, needs, abilities, and behaviors of users themselves.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ensure that devices and services are designed with security usability in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
