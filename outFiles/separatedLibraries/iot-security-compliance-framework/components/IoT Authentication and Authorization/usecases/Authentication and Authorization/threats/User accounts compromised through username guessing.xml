<threat ref="CAPEC-112-USERNAME" name="User accounts compromised through username guessing" state="Expose" source="MANUAL" owner="" library="">
                            <desc>	&lt;p&gt;Attackers could perform a brute force attack against the login function by choosing a simple password that users are likely to use for the site, and that meets the site&amp;#8217;s password policy. Then they could use an automated script to iterate through a list of possible usernames. These could be obtained from a dictionary, or generated through pure brute force means. &lt;/p&gt;

 This type of attack cannot be defended against using an account lockout policy because each username is only attempted once.</desc>
