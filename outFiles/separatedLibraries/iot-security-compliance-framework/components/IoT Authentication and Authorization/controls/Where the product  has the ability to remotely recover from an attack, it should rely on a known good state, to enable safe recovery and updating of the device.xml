                    <desc>	&lt;p&gt;The ability to remotely recover from these situations should rely on a known good state, such as locally storing a known good version to enable safe recovery and updating of the device. This will avoid denial of service and costly recalls or maintenance visits, whilst managing the risk of potential takeover of the device by an attacker subverting update or other network communications mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
