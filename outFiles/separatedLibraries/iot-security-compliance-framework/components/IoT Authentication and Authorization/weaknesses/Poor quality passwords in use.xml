                    <desc>The product does not enforce a strong password policy, which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts through brute force or dictionary based attacks.

An authentication mechanism is only as strong as its credentials. For this reason, it is important to require users to have strong passwords. Lack of password complexity significantly reduces the search space when trying to guess user's passwords, making brute-force attacks easier.  </desc>
