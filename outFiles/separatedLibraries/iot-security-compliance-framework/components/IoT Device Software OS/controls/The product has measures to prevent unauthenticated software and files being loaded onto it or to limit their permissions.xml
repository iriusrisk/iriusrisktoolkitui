                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;The product has measures to prevent unauthenticated software and files being loaded onto it. In the event that the product is intended to allow unauthenticated software, such software should only be run with limited permissions and/or sandbox.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The product should have software execution control to limit which software applications and services are able to run on the Operating System and to control the exposed attack surface of the system by reducing the number of potential vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Software execution control is used in combination with an administrator defined set of rules, that define which software a non-privileged user is able to execute. These rules can be based on:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Software's properties e.g. name, signature, etc.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;More generic rules e.g. permitting execution of files based on their storage location on the system.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the event that the product is intended to allow unauthenticated software, such software should only be run with limited permissions and/or sandbox (security mechanism which executes the software in a restricted operating system environment).&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
