                            <desc>	&lt;p&gt;If attackers gain access to the application or the application server, then they could directly access the data store using the privilege assigned to the application. If the data store user account used by the application has elevated privileges then this could allow attackers to perform unauthorised operations such as dropping tables, modifying the database schema or modifying data.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
