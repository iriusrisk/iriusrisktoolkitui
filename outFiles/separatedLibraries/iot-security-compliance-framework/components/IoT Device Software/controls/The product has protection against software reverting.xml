                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;The product has protection against reverting the software to an earlier and potentially less secure version.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Software updates perform numerous tasks and they are available for both Operating System and individual software programs. Updates can apply a wide range of revisions into a system such as adding new features, removing outdated features, updating drivers, fixing bugs, and most importantly, fixing security holes. For that reason the product should have protection against reverting software to an earlier, out-of-date and probably insecure version.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ensure that the product has mechanisms against software reverting.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
