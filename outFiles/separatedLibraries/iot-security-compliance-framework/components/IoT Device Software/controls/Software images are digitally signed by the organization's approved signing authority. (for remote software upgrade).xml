                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Where remote software upgrade can be supported by the device, the software images are digitally signed by the organization's approved signing authority.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Code signing is the process of using a certificate-based digital signature to sign executables and scripts in order to confirm the software author and ensure that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed. Certificate authority (CA) acts as a trusted third party, trusted both by the software author and the device, and verifies the entity's identity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ensure that for remote software upgrades, the software images are digitally signed by the organization's approved signing authority.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
