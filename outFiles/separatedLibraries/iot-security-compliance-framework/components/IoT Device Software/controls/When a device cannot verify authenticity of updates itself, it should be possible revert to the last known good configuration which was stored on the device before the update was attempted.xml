                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;When a device cannot verify authenticity of updates itself, it should be possible revert to the last known good configuration which was stored on the device before the update was attempted.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; To implement certain control capabilities into a system, you'll want to remotely reset the device so as to achieve a known-good state and recover from errors and implement new configuration changes. You may also want to be able reset the device to a factory default configuration, which is useful when you want to decommission a device or as a more invasive way to recover from unknown error conditions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, issuing a command to update or reload firmware is very important in order maintain security of the remote device, implement feature enhancements, and patch bugs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When a device cannot verify authenticity of updates itself, it should be possible revert to the last known good configuration which was stored on the device before the update was attempted.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
