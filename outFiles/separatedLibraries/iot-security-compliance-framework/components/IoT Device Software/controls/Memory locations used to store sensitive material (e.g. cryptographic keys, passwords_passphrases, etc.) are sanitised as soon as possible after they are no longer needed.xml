                    <desc>	&lt;p&gt;Memory locations used to store sensitive material (e.g. cryptographic keys, passwords/passphrases, etc.) are sanitized as soon as possible after they are no longer needed. These can include but are not limited to locations on the heap, the stack, and statically-allocated storage.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
