                    <desc>The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, the server's identity. 

If the server's identity is not validated, an attacker could spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The software might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the software might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host. 
 
One way to perform server authentication is by using X509 certificates over TLS.
