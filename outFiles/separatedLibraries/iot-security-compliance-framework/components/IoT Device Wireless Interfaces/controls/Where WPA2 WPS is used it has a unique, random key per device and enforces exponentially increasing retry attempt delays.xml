                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Where WPA2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WPS&lt;/span&gt; is used it has a unique, random key per device and enforces exponentially increasing retry attempt delays.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When the same secret key programmed into a product at manufacturing is shared between multiple devices, it exposes them to various types of malicious attacks. In other words, this means that if an attacker is able to access one device, he/she can possibly log into a huge quantity of other devices that share the same secret key.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Where WPA2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WPS&lt;/span&gt; is used and allows users to enter passwords as many times as they want, an attacker may try to exploit this by using scripts that enter different combinations until the password cracks. To prevent this kind of brute force attack, the product should have defense such as exponentially increasing retry attempt delays.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ensure that where WPA2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WPS&lt;/span&gt; is used it has a unique, random key per device and enforces exponentially increasing retry attempt delays.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
