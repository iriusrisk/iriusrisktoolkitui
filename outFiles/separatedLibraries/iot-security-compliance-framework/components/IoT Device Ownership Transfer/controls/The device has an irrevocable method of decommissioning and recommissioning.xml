                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;In case of ownership change, the device has an irrevocable method of decommissioning and recommissioning.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Decommissioning is the last stage in the device's life cycle. For example an IoT device may need to be decommissioned, because it will be commissioned in another network (recommissioning) or because it is due for replacement which is the case when the device reaches its end of life. In both cases resetting the device to its factory configuration is an important activity and should be handled properly by an irrevocable method.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ensure that the device has an irrevocable method of decommissioning and recommissioning.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
