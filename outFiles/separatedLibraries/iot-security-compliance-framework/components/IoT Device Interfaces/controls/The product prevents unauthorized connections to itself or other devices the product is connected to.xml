                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;The product prevents unauthorized connections to itself or other devices the product is connected to.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A significant vulnerability is networked system accessibility. Because by definition IoT systems are connected to the Internet, attacks can be conducted remotely, either by direct access to networked control interfaces, or by downloading malware to devices. For that reason the product should prevent unauthorized connections to itself or other devices the product is connected to, for example by firewalls.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A firewall is software used to maintain the security of a private network and block unauthorized access to or from private networks and are often employed to prevent unauthorized Web users or malware from gaining access to private networks connected to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ensure that the product prevents unauthorized connections to itself or other devices the product is connected to. For example, there is a firewall on each interface and internet layer protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
