                    <desc>	&lt;p&gt;As far as reasonably possible, devices should remain operating and locally functional in the case of a loss of network connection and should recover cleanly in the case of restoration of a loss of power. Devices should be able to return to a network in a sensible state and in an orderly fashion, rather than in a massive scale reconnect.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Continuous operation ensures that devices provide basic functionality without relying on other systems or networks. It is important to note here that a device should only be required to supply basic features when the network is inaccessible. Devices should provide continuous operation if the network or the Internet is inaccessible. Manual controls where needed, either physical buttons &amp;#8211; or digital &amp;#8211; on the device itself.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
