                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;The product's OS kernel and its functions are prevented from being called by external product level interfaces and unauthorized applications.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's Operating System, with complete control over everything in the system. Therefore only internal calls should be allowed and only from authorized applications in order to minimize the exposed attack surface.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Configure the product's OS kernel and its functions to prevented being called by external product level interfaces and unauthorized applications.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
