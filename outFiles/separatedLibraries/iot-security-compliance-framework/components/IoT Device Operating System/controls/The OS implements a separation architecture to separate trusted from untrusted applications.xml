                    <desc>	&lt;p&gt;The trusted execution environment, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TEE&lt;/span&gt;, is an isolated area on the main processor of a device that is separate from the main operating system. It ensures that data is stored, processed and protected in a trusted environment. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TEE&lt;/span&gt; provides protection for any connected "thing" by enabling end-to-end security, protected execution of authenticated code, confidentiality, authenticity, privacy, system integrity and data access rights.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;It is already used widely in complex devices, such as smartphones, tablets and set-top boxes, and also by manufacturers of constrained chipsets and IoT devices in sectors such as industrial automation, automotive and healthcare, who are now recognizing its value in protecting connected things.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
