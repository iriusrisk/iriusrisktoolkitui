                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;All OS command line access to the most privileged accounts has been removed from the Operating System.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The Devices' OS's most privileged account or "superuser" is a special user account used for system administration, capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes. For that reason it is often recommended that no-one use "superuser" as their normal user account and any access from the command line should be removed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Remove all OS command line access to the most privileged accounts from the Operating System.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
