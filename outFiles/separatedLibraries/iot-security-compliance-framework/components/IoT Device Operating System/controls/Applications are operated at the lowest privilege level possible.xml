                    <desc>	&lt;p&gt;Applications are operated at the lowest privilege level possible. 	Rationale: Applications are following the principle of the least privilege like every module (such as processes, a users, etc.), which means that they must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for their legitimate purpose. Doing this minimizes the amount of damage that results if an attacker successfully exploits any known or future vulnerability. 	Remediation: Configure the Operating System to operate applications at the lowest privilege level possible.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
