                            &lt;li&gt;Check that the application adequately enforces access control across those
                            boundaries. &amp;nbsp;For example, does it require some form of authentication at the
                            boundary? &amp;nbsp;Or does it prevent access across the boundary entirely?&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;/ol&gt;

                        The application does not sufficiently encapsulate critical data or functionality.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Encapsulation is about drawing strong boundaries. In a web browser that might mean
                        ensuring that your mobile code cannot be abused by other mobile code. On the server it might
                        mean differentiation between validated data and unvalidated data, between one user's data and
                        another's, or between data users are allowed to see and data that they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
