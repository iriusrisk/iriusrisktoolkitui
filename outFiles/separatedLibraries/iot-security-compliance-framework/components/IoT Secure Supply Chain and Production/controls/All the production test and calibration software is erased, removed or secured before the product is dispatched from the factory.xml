                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;All the production test and calibration software used during manufacture is erased, removed or secured before the product is dispatched from the factory.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Rationale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The product should have all of the production test and calibration software used during manufacture erased, removed or secured before the product is dispatched from the factory. This is to prevent alteration of the product post manufacture when using authorized production software, for example, hacking of the RF characteristics for greater RF &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ERP&lt;/span&gt;. Where such functionality is required in a service center, it should be erased or removed upon completion of any servicing activities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Remediation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Erase, remove or secure all the production test and calibration software used during manufacture, before the product is dispatched from the factory.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
