          <desc>When you are into a VNet, you can search its resources, but that shall be used only when you
                        know the resource name. The problem occurs when you don't know these names and you can easily
                        find the resources. Therefore anyone with access to the system could easily find all the
                        resources and gain access, regardless of having any information about them.
