          <desc>Make sure that you securely store your credentials. This can be done differently depending on
                        your environment and where you store your credentials. For example, if you store your
                        credentials in a configuration file, make sure that you set appropriate permissions on that file
                        to prevent unwanted access. If you are using Google App Engine, consider using StorageByKeyName
                        to store your credentials.
