<control ref='GOOGLE-VM06' name='Configure and set up HTTPS/SSL for production environment ' platform='' cost='1' risk='0' state='Recommended' owner='' library='' source='MANUAL'>
          <desc>For production web systems, you should configure HTTPS/SSL. HTTPS/SSL can be set up either by
                        setting up an instance to terminate HTTPS or by configuring HTTPS load balancing. HTTPS/SSL does
                        involve some initial complexity, requiring you to perform the following tasks: Register a domain
                        name. Acquire an SSL certificate from a certificate authority.
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        Register the certificate with your HTTPS load balancer and its connected instances, or configure
                        an SSL-terminated web server or proxy on one or more Compute Engine instances. If you have set
                        up SSL-serving domains before, it should be straightforward to do the same with Google Compute
                        Engine. If not, you might find it easier to use a different security method, such as port
                        forwarding or SOCKS proxy.
                        &lt;/div&gt;
