          <desc>Use networks within projects to isolate groups of VM instances.

                        Each project supports up to five isolated networks. Each network constitutes a global IP address
                        space. This means that you can create resources, such as Google Compute Engine Virtual Machine
                        (VM) instances, in multiple geographic regions, and the resources will share the same IP address
                        space because they are on the same virtual network. Note that, despite the flat network address
                        space, you still incur normal egress charges when you leave your zone. You can request a quota
                        increase to support up to 15 isolated networks in each project.
