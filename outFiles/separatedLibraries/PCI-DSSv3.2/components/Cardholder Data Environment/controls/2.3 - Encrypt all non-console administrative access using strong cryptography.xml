<control ref="PCI-R2-2.3" name="2.3 - Encrypt all non-console administrative access using strong cryptography" platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;If non-console (including remote) administration does not use secure authentication
                        and
                        encrypted communications, sensitive administrative or operational level information (like
                        administrator's
                        IDs and passwords) can be revealed to an eavesdropper. A malicious individual could use this
                        information to
                        access the network, become administrator, and steal data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Clear-text protocols (such as HTTP, telnet, etc.) do not encrypt traffic or logon
                        details, making
                        it easy for an eavesdropper to intercept this information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;To be considered "strong cryptography," industry-recognized protocols with
                        appropriate
                        key
                        strengths and key management should be in place as applicable for the type of technology in use.

                            administrative access
                            is encrypted by performing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;2.3.a Observe an administrator log on to each system and examine system
                            configurations to verify
                            that a strong encryption method is invoked before the administrator's password is
                            requested.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;2.3.b Review services and parameter files on systems to determine that Telnet and
                            other insecure
                            remote-login commands are not available for non-console access. &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;2.3.c Observe an administrator log on to each system to verify that administrator
                            access to any
                            web-based management interfaces is encrypted with strong cryptography. &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;2.3.d Examine vendor documentation and interview personnel to verify that strong
                            cryptography for
