<control ref="PCI-R9-9.1.1" name="9.1.1 - Use video cameras or access control mechanisms to monitor access to sensitive areas" platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">

                        &lt;p&gt;When investigating physical breaches, these controls can help identify the individuals
                        that
                        physically accessed the sensitive areas, as well as when they entered and exited.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Criminals attempting to gain physical access to sensitive areas will often attempt to
                        disable or
                        bypass the monitoring controls. To protect these controls from tampering, video cameras could be
                        positioned
                        so they are out of reach and/or be monitored to detect tampering. Similarly, access control
                        mechanisms could
                        be monitored or have physical protections installed to prevent them being damaged or disabled by
                        malicious
                        individuals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
