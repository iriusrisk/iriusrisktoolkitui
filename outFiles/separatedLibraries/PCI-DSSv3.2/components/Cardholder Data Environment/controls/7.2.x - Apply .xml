                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Without a mechanism to restrict access based on user's need to know, a user may
                        unknowingly be
                        granted access to cardholder data. Access control systems automate the process of restricting
                        access and
                        assigning privileges. Additionally, a default "deny-all" setting ensures no one is
                        granted
                        access until and
                        unless a rule is established specifically granting such access. Entities may have one or more
                        access
                        controls systems to manage user access.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
