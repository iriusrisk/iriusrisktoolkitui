                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;This methodology must include the following:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;- Is based on industry-accepted penetration testing approaches (for example, NIST
                        SP800-115)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                        vulnerabilities listed
                        in Requirement 6.5&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;- Defines network-layer penetration tests to include components that support network
                        functions as
                        well as operating systems&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;- Includes review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the
                        last 12
                        months&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;- Specifies retention of penetration testing results and remediation activities
                        results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The intent of a penetration test is to simulate a real-world attack situation with a
                        goal of
                        identifying how far an attacker would be able to penetrate into an environment. This allows an
                        entity to
                        gain a better understanding of their potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against
                        attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an
                        active process
                        that may include exploiting identified vulnerabilities. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be
                        one of the
                        first steps a penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it
                        is not the
                        only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration
                        tester will
                        often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Penetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools
                        may be used,
                        the tester uses their knowledge of systems to penetrate into an environment. Often the tester
                        will chain
                        several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For
                        example, if the
                        tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, they will then use the compromised
                        server as a
                        point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a
                        tester is able
                        to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the
                        environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
