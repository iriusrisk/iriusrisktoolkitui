<control ref="PCI-R9-9.5" name="9.5 - Phisically secure all media including backups" platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Controls for physically securing media are intended to prevent unauthorized persons
                        from
                        gaining access to cardholder data on any type of media. Cardholder data is susceptible to
                        unauthorized
                        viewing, copying, or scanning if it is unprotected while it is on removable or portable media,
                        printed out,
                        or left on someone's desk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;If stored in a non-secured facility, backups that contain cardholder data may easily be
                        lost,
                        stolen, or copied for malicious intent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Periodically reviewing the storage facility enables the organization to address
                        identified security
                        issues in a timely manner, minimizing the potential risk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
