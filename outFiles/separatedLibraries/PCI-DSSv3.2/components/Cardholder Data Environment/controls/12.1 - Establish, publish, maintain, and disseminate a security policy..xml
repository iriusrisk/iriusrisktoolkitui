                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;A company's information security policy creates the roadmap for implementing security
                        measures
                        to protect its most valuable assets. All personnel should be aware of the sensitivity of data
                        and their
                        responsibilities for protecting it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;- Review the security policy at least annually and update the policy when the
                        environment changes:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Security threats and protection methods evolve rapidly. Without updating the security
                        policy to
                        reflect relevant changes, new protection measures to fight against these threats are not
                        addressed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
