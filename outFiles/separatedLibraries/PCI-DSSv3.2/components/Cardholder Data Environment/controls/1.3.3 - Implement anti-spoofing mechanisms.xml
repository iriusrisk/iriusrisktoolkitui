                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Normally a packet contains the IP address of the computer that originally sent it so
                        other
                        computers in the network know where the packet came from. Malicious individuals will often try
                        to spoof (or
                        imitate) the sending IP address so that the target system believes the packet is from a trusted
                        source.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Filtering packets coming into the network helps to, among other things, ensure packets
                        are not
                        "spoofed" to look like they are coming from an organization's own internal
                        network.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
