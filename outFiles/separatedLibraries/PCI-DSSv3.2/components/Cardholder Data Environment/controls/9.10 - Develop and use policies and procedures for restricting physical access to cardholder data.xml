                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Criminals will often pose as authorized maintenance personnel in order to gain access
                        to POS
                        devices. All third parties requesting access to devices should always be verified before being
                        provided
                        access-for example, by checking with management or phoning the POS maintenance company
                        (such as
                        the vendor
                        or acquirer) for verification. Many criminals will try to fool personnel by dressing for the
                        part (for
                        example, carrying toolboxes and dressed in work wear), and could also be knowledgeable about
                        locations of
                        devices, so it's important personnel are trained to follow procedures at all times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Another trick criminals like to use is to send a "new" POS system with
                        instructions for
                        swapping it
                        with a legitimate system and "returning" the legitimate system to a specified
                        address. The
                        criminals may
                        even provide return postage as they are very keen to get their hands on these devices. Personnel
                        always
                        verify with their manager or supplier that the device is legitimate and came from a trusted
                        source before
                        installing it or using it for business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
