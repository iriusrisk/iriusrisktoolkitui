<control ref="PCI-R9-9.9" name="9.9 - Protect devices that capture payment card data via direct physical interaction with the card from tampering and substitution." platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Criminals attempt to steal cardholder data by stealing and/or manipulating
                        card-reading devices
                        and terminals. For example, they will try to steal devices so they can learn how to break into
                        them, and
                        they often try to replace legitimate devices with fraudulent devices that send them payment card
                        information
                        every time a card is entered. Criminals will also try to add "skimming" components
                        to the
                        outside of
                        devices, which are designed to capture payment card details before they even enter the
                        device-for example,
                        by attaching an additional card reader on top of the legitimate card reader so that the payment
                        card details
                        are captured twice: once by the criminal's component and then by the device's
                        legitimate
                        component. In this
                        way, transactions may still be completed without interruption while the criminal is "skimming"
                        the payment
                        card information during the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;This requirement is recommended, but not required, for manual key-entry components such
                        as computer
                        keyboards and POS keypads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Additional best practices on skimming prevention are available on the PCI SSC website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
