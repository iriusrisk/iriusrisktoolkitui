<control ref="PCI-R6-6.1" name="6.1 - Establish a process to identify security vulnerabilities" platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;The intent of this requirement is that organizations keep up to date with new
                        vulnerabilities
                        that may impact their environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Sources for vulnerability information should be trustworthy and often include vendor
                        websites,
                        industry news groups, mailing list, or RSS feeds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Once an organization identifies a vulnerability that could affect their environment,
                        the risk that
                        the vulnerability poses must be evaluated and ranked. The organization must therefore have a
                        method in place
                        to evaluate vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis and assign risk rankings to those
                        vulnerabilities. This is
                        not achieved by an ASV scan or internal vulnerability scan, rather this requires a process to
                        actively
                        monitor industry sources for vulnerability information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Classifying the risks (for example, as "high," "medium," or
                        "low") allows organizations
                        to
                        identify, prioritize, and address the highest risk items more quickly and reduce the likelihood
                        that
                        vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk will be exploited.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
