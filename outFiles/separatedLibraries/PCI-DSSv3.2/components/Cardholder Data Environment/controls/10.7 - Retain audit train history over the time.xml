<control ref="PCI-R10-10.7" name="10.7 - Retain audit train history over the time" platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Retain audit trail history for at least one year, with a minimum of three months
                        immediately
                        available for analysis (for example, online, archived, or restorable from backup).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Retaining logs for at least a year allows for the fact that it often takes a while to
                        notice that a
                        compromise has occurred or is occurring, and allows investigators sufficient log history to
                        better determine
                        the length of time of a potential breach and potential system(s) impacted. By having three
                        months of logs
                        immediately available, an entity can quickly identify and minimize impact of a data breach.
                        Storing logs in
                        off-line locations could prevent them from being readily available, resulting in longer time
                        frames to
                        restore log data, perform analysis, and identify impacted systems or data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
