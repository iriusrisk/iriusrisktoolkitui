                    <desc>Specially affected systems by anti-virus and other malware are personal computers and servers.

                        &lt;p&gt;There is a constant stream of attacks using widely published exploits, often called
                        &amp;quot;zero
                        day&amp;quot; (an attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability), against otherwise
                        secured
                        systems. Without an anti-virus solution that is updated regularly, these new forms of malicious
                        software can
                        attack systems, disable a network, or lead to compromise of data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
