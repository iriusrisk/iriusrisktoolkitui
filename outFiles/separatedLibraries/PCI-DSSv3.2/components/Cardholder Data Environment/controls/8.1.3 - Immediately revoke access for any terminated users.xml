                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;If an employee has left the company and still has access to the network via their
                        user account,
                        unnecessary or malicious access to cardholder data could occur-either by the former
                        employee or
                        by a
                        malicious user who exploits the old and/or unused account. To prevent unauthorized access, user
                        credentials
                        and other authentication methods therefore need to be revoked promptly (as soon as possible)
                        upon the
                        employee's departure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
