                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Firewall rules and router configuration should be reviewed at least each six months.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;This review gives the organization an opportunity at least every six months to clean up
                        any
                        unneeded, outdated, or incorrect rules, and ensure that all rule sets allow only authorized
                        services and
                        ports that match the documented business justifications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Organizations with a high volume of changes to firewall and router rule sets may wish
                        to consider
                        performing reviews more frequently, to ensure that the rule sets continue to meet the needs of
                        the business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
