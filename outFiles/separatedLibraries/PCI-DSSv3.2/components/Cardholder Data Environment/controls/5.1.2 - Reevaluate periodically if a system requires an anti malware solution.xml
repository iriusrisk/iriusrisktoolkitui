                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;For systems considered to be not commonly affected by malicious software, perform
                        periodic
                        evaluations to identify and evaluate evolving malware threats in order to confirm whether such
                        systems
                        continue to not require anti-virus software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Typically, mainframes, mid-range computers (such as AS/400) and similar systems may not
                        currently
                        be commonly targeted or affected by malware. However, industry trends for malicious software can
                        change
                        quickly, so it is important for organizations to be aware of new malware that might affect their
                        systems-for
                        example, by monitoring vendor security notices and anti-virus news groups to determine whether
                        their systems
                        might be coming under threat from new and evolving malware.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Trends in malicious software should be included in the identification of new security
                        vulnerabilities, and methods to address new trends should be incorporated into the company's
                        configuration
                        standards and protection mechanisms as needed&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
