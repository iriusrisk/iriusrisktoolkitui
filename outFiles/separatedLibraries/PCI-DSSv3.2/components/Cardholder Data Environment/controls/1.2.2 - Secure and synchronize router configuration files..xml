<control ref="PCI-R1-1.2.2" name="1.2.2 - Secure and synchronize router configuration files." platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;While the running (or active) router configuration files include the current, secure
                        settings,
                        the start-up files (which are used when routers are re-started or booted) must be updated with
                        the same
                        secure settings to ensure these settings are applied when the start-up configuration is run.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Because they only run occasionally, start-up configuration files are often forgotten
                        and are not
                        updated. When a router re-starts and loads a start-up configuration that has not been updated
                        with the same
                        secure settings as those in the running configuration, it may result in weaker rules that allow
                        malicious
                        individuals into the network&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
