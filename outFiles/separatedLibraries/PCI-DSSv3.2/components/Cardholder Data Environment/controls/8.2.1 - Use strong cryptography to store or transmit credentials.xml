                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Many network devices and applications transmit unencrypted, readable passwords across
                        the
                        network and/or store passwords without encryption. A malicious individual can easily intercept
                        unencrypted
                        passwords during transmission using a "sniffer," or directly access unencrypted
                        passwords in
                        files where
                        they are stored, and use this data to gain unauthorized access.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
