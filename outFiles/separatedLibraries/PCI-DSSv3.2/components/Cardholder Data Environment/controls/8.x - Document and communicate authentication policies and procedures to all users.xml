                    <desc>This has to include:&amp;nbsp;
                        &lt;br /&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;-&amp;nbsp;Guidance on selecting strong authentication credentials&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;- Guidance for how users should protect their authentication credentials&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;- Instructions not to reuse previously used passwords&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;- Instructions to change passwords if there is any suspicion the&amp;nbsp;password
                        could be
                        compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Communicating password/authentication policies and procedures to all users helps those
                        users
                        understand and abide by the policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;For example, guidance on selecting strong passwords may include suggestions to help
                        personnel
                        select hard-to-guess passwords that don't contain dictionary words, and that don't
                        contain
                        information about
                        the user (such as the user ID, names of family members, date of birth, etc.). Guidance for
                        protecting
                        authentication credentials may include not writing down passwords or saving them in insecure
                        files, and
                        being alert for malicious individuals who may attempt to exploit their passwords (for example,
                        by calling an
                        employee and asking for their password so the caller can "troubleshoot a problem").&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Instructing users to change passwords if there is a chance the password is no longer
                        secure can
                        prevent malicious users from using a legitimate password to gain unauthorized access.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
