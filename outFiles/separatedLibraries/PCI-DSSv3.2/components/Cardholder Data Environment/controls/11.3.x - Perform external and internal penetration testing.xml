                        any
                        significant infrastructure or application upgrade or modification (such as an operating system
                        upgrade, a
                        sub-network added to the environment, or a web server added to the environment).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Perform &lt;i&gt;internal &lt;/i&gt;penetration testing at least annually and after any
                        significant
                        infrastructure or application upgrade or modification (such as an operating system upgrade, a
                        sub-network
                        added to the environment, or a web server added to the environment).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Exploitable vulnerabilities found during penetration testing are corrected and testing
                        is repeated
                        to verify the corrections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Penetration testing conducted on a regular basis and after significant changes to the
                        environment
                        is a proactive security measure that helps minimize potential access to the CDE by malicious
                        individuals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The determination of what constitutes a significant upgrade or modification is highly
                        dependent on
                        the configuration of a given environment. If an upgrade or modification could allow access to
                        cardholder
                        data or affect the security of the cardholder data environment, then it could be considered
                        significant.
                        Performing penetration tests after network upgrades and modifications provides assurance that
                        the controls
                        assumed to be in place are still working effectively after the upgrade or modification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
