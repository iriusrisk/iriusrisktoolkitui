                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Without account-lockout mechanisms in place, an attacker can continually attempt to
                        guess a
                        password through manual or automated tools (for example, password cracking), until they achieve
                        success and
                        gain access to a user's account.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The lockout duration to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator enables the
                        user ID.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;If an account is locked out due to someone continually trying to guess a password,
                        controls to
                        delay reactivation of these locked accounts stops the malicious individual from continually
                        guessing the
                        password (they will have to stop for a minimum of 30 minutes until the account is reactivated).
                        Additionally, if reactivation must be requested, the admin or help desk can validate that it is
                        the actual
                        account owner requesting reactivation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
