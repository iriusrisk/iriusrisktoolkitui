<control ref="PCI-R11-11.1" name="11.1 - Test the presence of wireless access points" platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;- Detect and identify all authorized and unauthorized wireless access points on a
                        quarterly
                        basis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;- Maintain an inventory of authorized wireless access points including a documented
                        business
                        justification.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Implementation and/or exploitation of wireless technology within a network are some of
                        the most
                        common paths for malicious users to gain access to the network and cardholder data. If a
                        wireless device or
                        network is installed without a company's knowledge, it can allow an attacker to easily and
                        "invisibly" enter
                        the network. Unauthorized wireless devices may be hidden within or attached to a computer or
                        other system
                        component, or be attached directly to a network port or network device, such as a switch or
                        router. Any such
                        unauthorized device could result in an unauthorized access point into the environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Knowing which wireless devices are authorized can help administrators quickly identify
                        non-authorized wireless devices, and responding to the identification of unauthorized wireless
                        access points
                        helps to proactively minimize the exposure of CDE to malicious individuals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Due to the ease with which a wireless access point can be attached to a network, the
                        difficulty in
                        detecting their presence, and the increased risk presented by unauthorized wireless devices,
                        these processes
                        must be performed even when a policy exists prohibiting the use of wireless technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The size and complexity of a particular environment will dictate the appropriate tools
                        and
                        processes to be used to provide sufficient assurance that a rogue wireless access point has not
                        been
                        installed in the environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
