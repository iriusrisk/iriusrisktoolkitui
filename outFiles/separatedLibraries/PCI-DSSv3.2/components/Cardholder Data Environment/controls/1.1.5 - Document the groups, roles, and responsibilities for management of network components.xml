                        are aware
                        of who is responsible for the security of all network components, and that those assigned to
                        manage
                        components are aware of their responsibilities. If roles and responsibilities are not formally
                        assigned,
                        devices could be left unmanaged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
