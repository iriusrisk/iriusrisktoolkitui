<control ref="PCI-R2-2.2.1" name="2.2.1 - Implement one function per server" platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Implement only one primary function per server to prevent functions that require
                        different
                        security levels from co-existing on the same server. (For example, web servers, database
                        servers, and DNS
                        should be implemented on separate servers.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;If server functions that need different security levels are located on the same server,
                        the
                        security level of the functions with higher security needs would be reduced due to the presence
                        of the
                        lower-security functions. Additionally, the server functions with a lower security level may
                        introduce
                        security weaknesses to other functions on the same server. By considering the security needs of
                        different
                        server functions as part of the system configuration standards and related processes,
                        organizations can
                        ensure that functions requiring different security levels don't co-exist on the same
                        server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
