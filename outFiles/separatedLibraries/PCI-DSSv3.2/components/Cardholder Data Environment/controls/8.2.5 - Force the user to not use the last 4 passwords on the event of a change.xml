                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;If password history isn't maintained, the effectiveness of changing passwords
                        is
                        reduced, as
                        previous passwords can be reused over and over. Requiring that passwords cannot be reused for a
                        period of
                        time reduces the likelihood that passwords that have been guessed or brute-forced will be used
                        in the
                        future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
