<control ref="PCI-R8-8.3.2" name="8.3.2 - Use multi-factor authentication for remote network access" platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;This requirement is intended to apply to all personnel-including general users,
                        administrators,
                        and vendors (for support or maintenance) with remote access to the network-where that
                        remote
                        access could
                        lead to access to the CDE. If remote access is to an entity's network that has appropriate
                        segmentation,
                        such that remote users cannot access or impact the cardholder data environment, multi-factor
                        authentication
                        for remote access to that network would not be required. However, multi-factor authentication is
                        required
                        for any remote access to networks with access to the cardholder data environment, and is
                        recommended for all
                        remote access to the entity's networks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
