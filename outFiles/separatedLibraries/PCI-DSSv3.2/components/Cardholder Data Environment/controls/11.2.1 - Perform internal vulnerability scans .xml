                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Perform quarterly internal vulnerability scans. Address vulnerabilities and perform
                        rescans to
                        verify all "high risk" vulnerabilities are resolved in accordance with the entity's
                        vulnerability ranking
                        (per Requirement 6.1). Scans must be performed by qualified personnel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;An established process for identifying vulnerabilities on internal systems requires
                        that
                        vulnerability scans be conducted quarterly. Vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk to the
                        environment (for
                        example, ranked "High" per Requirement 6.1) should be resolved with the highest
                        priority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Internal vulnerability scans can be performed by qualified, internal staff that are
                        reasonably
                        independent of the system component(s) being scanned (for example, a firewall administrator
                        should not be
                        responsible for scanning the firewall), or an entity may choose to have internal vulnerability
                        scans
                        performed by a firm specializing in vulnerability scanning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;11.2.1.a Review the scan reports and verify that four quarterly internal scans
                            occurred in the
                            most recent 12- month period. &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;11.2.1.b Review the scan reports and verify that all "high risk"
                            vulnerabilities
                            are addressed
                            and the scan process includes rescans to verify that the "high risk"
                            vulnerabilities (as
                            defined in PCI
                            DSS Requirement 6.1) are resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;11.2.1.c Interview personnel to verify that the scan was performed by a qualified
