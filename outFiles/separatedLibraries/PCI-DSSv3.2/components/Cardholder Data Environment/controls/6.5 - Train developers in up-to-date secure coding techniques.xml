<control ref="PCI-R6-6.5" name="6.5 - Train developers in up-to-date secure coding techniques" platform="" cost="0" risk="0" state="Recommended" owner="" library="" source="MANUAL">
                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;The application layer is high-risk and may be targeted by both internal and external
                        threats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Requirements 6.5.1 through 6.5.10 are the minimum controls that should be in place, and
                        organizations should incorporate the relevant secure coding practices as applicable to the
                        particular
                        technology in their environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Application developers should be properly trained to identify and resolve issues
                        related to these
                        (and other) common coding vulnerabilities. Having staff knowledgeable of secure coding
                        guidelines should
                        minimize the number of security vulnerabilities introduced through poor coding practices.
                        Training for
                        developers may be provided in-house or by third parties and should be applicable for technology
                        used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;As industry-accepted secure coding practices change, organizational coding practices
                        and developer
                        training should likewise be updated to address new threats-for example, memory scraping
                        attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The vulnerabilities identified in 6.5.1 through 6.5.10 provide a minimum baseline. It
                        is up to the
                        organization to remain up to date with vulnerability trends and incorporate appropriate measures
                        into their
                        secure coding practices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
