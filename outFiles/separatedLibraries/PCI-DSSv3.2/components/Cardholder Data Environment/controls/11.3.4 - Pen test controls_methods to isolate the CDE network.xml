                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;If segmentation is used to isolate the CDE from other networks, perform penetration
                        tests at
                        least annually and after any changes to segmentation controls/methods to verify that the
                        segmentation
                        methods are operational and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the
                        CDE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Penetration testing is an important tool to confirm that any segmentation in place to
                        isolate the
                        CDE from other networks is effective. The penetration testing should focus on the segmentation
                        controls,
                        both from outside the entity's network and from inside the network but outside of the CDE,
                        to
                        confirm that
                        they are not able to get through the segmentation controls to access the CDE. For example,
                        network testing
                        and/or scanning for open ports, to verify no connectivity between in-scope and out-of-scope
                        networks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                            methodology to verify
                            that penetration- testing procedures are defined to test all segmentation methods to confirm
                            they are
                            operational and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;11.3.4.b Examine the results from the most recent penetration test to verify that:
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Penetration testing to verify segmentation controls is performed at
                            least annually and
                            after any changes to segmentation controls/methods. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The penetration testing covers all segmentation controls/methods in use.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The penetration testing verifies that segmentation controls/methods are
                            operational
                            and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
