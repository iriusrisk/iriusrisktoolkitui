                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Cryptographic keys must be strongly protected because those who obtain access will be
                        able to
                        decrypt data. Key-encrypting keys, if used, must be at least as strong as the data-encrypting
                        key in order
                        to ensure proper protection of the key that encrypts the data as well as the data encrypted with
                        that key.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The requirement to protect keys from disclosure and misuse applies to both
                        data-encrypting keys and
                        key-encrypting keys. Because one key-encrypting key may grant access to many data-encrypting
                        keys, the
                        key-encrypting keys require strong protection measures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                            necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key-encrypting keys are stored separately from data- encrypting keys.
                            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
