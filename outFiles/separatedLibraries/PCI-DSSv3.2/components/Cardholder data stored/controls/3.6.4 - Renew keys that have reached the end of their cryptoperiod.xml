                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;A cryptoperiod is the time span during which a particular cryptographic key can be
                        used for its
                        defined purpose. Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to,
                        the strength
                        of the underlying algorithm, size or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and the
                        sensitivity of the
                        data being encrypted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Periodic changing of encryption keys when the keys have reached the end of their
                        cryptoperiod is
                        imperative to minimize the risk of someone's obtaining the encryption keys, and using them
                        to
                        decrypt data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
