                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Applications that fail to adequately encrypt network traffic using strong
                        cryptography are at
                        increased risk of being compromised and exposing cardholder data. If an attacker is able to
                        exploit weak
                        cryptographic processes, they may be able to gain control of an application or even gain
                        clear-text access
                        to encrypted data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
