                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Applications can unintentionally leak information about their configuration or
                        internal
                        workings, or expose privileged information through improper error handling methods. Attackers
                        use this
                        weakness to steal sensitive data or compromise the system altogether. If a malicious individual
                        can create
                        errors that the application does not handle properly, they can gain detailed system information,
                        create
                        denial-of-service interruptions, cause security to fail, or crash the server. For example, the
                        message &amp;quot;incorrect
                        password provided&amp;quot; tells an attacker the user ID provided was accurate and that they
                        should focus
                        their efforts only on the password. Use more generic error messages, like &amp;quot;data could
                        not be
                        verified.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
