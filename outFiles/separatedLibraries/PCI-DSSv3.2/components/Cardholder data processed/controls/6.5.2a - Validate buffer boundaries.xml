                    <desc>&lt;p&gt;Buffer overflows occur when an application does not have appropriate bounds checking
                        on its
                        buffer space. This can cause the information in the buffer to be pushed out of the buffer's
                        memory space and
                        into executable memory space. When this occurs, the attacker has the ability to insert malicious
                        code at the
                        end of the buffer and then push that malicious code into executable memory space by overflowing
                        the buffer.
                        The malicious code is then executed and often enables the attacker remote access to the
                        application and/or
                        infected system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
