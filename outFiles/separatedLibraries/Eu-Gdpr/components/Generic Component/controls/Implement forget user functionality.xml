                    <desc>Make sure that your deletion functionality also facilitates the manual deletion of one data subject (person of whom personal data is processed) at any given point in time. All data of the data subject should be deleted from the operational databases as well as back-ups.
          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
          Implementation Advice: You should develop a script to ensure the re-deletion of data subjects (persons of whom personal data is processed) who exercised their right to be forgotten and run it after each database restore. The data subjects should be deleted from the script whenever the retention period of the data has expired.
