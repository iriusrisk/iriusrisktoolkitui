                    <desc>Personal data is not automatically deleted when retention periods have expired, which means data must be manually deleted by an administrator who can easily forget this task.
          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
          Personal data that was deleted becomes operational again after a restore because the data was not deleted from the back-ups nor was there a process in place to reidentify and delete personal data that was previously deleted.
