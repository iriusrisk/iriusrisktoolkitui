<threat ref='CAPEC-94-IMAGES-BUILD-FILES' name='Attackers steal sensitive data from the docker images and build files by listening the communication between components' state='Expose' source='MANUAL' owner='' library=''>
              <desc>This type of attack targets the communication between two components (typically client
                                and server). The attacker places himself in the communication channel between the two
                                components. Whenever one component attempts to communicate with the other (data flow,
                                authentication challenges, etc.), the data first goes to the attacker, who has the
                                opportunity to observe or alter it, and it is then passed on to the other component as
                                if it was never intercepted. This interposition is transparent leaving the two
                                compromised components unaware of the potential corruption or leakage of their
                                communications. The potential for Man-in-the-Middle attacks yields an implicit lack of
                                trust in communication or identify between two components.
