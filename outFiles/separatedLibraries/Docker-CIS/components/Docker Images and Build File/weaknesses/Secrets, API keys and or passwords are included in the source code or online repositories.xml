          <desc>API keys, passwords or secrets included in the source code or in the configuration files can be leaked to users with access to the code. This access can be incidentally granted by publishing the source code on a package-form or an online, public repository.

          The unauthorized access to any of those secrets could lead to a compromise of sensitive data or a system.</desc>
