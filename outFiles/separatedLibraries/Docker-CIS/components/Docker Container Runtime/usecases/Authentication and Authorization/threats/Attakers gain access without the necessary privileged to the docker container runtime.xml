              <desc>An adversary is able to exploit features of the target that should be reserved for
                                privileged users or administrators but are exposed to use by lower or non-privileged
                                accounts. Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure
                                that only authorized users are able to access these resources. If access control
                                mechanisms are absent or misconfigured, a user may be able to access resources that are
                                intended only for higher level users. An adversary may be able to exploit this to
                                utilize a less trusted account to gain information and perform activities reserved for
                                more trusted accounts. This attack differs from privilege escalation and other privilege
                                stealing attacks in that the adversary never actually escalates their privileges but
                                instead is able to use a lesser degree of privilege to access resources that should be
                                (but are not) reserved for higher privilege accounts. Likewise, the adversary does not
                                exploit trust or subvert systems - all control functionality is working as configured
                                but the configuration does not adequately protect sensitive resources at an appropriate
                                level.
