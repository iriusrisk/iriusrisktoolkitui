              <desc>An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large number
                                of interactions with the target. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in
                                rate limiting or flow. When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from
                                accessing the service and can cause the target to crash. This attack differs from
                                resource depletion through leaks or allocations in that the latter attacks do not rely
                                on the volume of requests made to the target but instead focus on manipulation of the
                                target's operations. The key factor in a flooding attack is the number of requests the
                                adversary can make in a given period of time. The greater this number, the more likely
                                an attack is to succeed against a given target.
