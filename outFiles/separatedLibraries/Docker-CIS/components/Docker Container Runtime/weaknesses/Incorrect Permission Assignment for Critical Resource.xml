<weakness ref='CWE-732' name='Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource' state='0' impact='100'>
          <desc>The software specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that
                        resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.
                        When a resource is given a permissions setting that provides access to a wider range of actors
                        than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of
                        that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related
                        to program configuration, execution or sensitive user data.
