<weakness ref='CWE-120' name='Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (&apos;Classic Buffer Overflow&apos;)' state='0' impact='100'>
          <desc>The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the
                        input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
                        &lt;br /&gt;A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put more data in a
                        buffer than it can hold, or when a program attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the
                        boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer
                        overflows, is the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; case in which the program copies the buffer
                        without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic
                        overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of
                        security protections.
