          <desc>The software stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by
                        unauthorized actors.
                        If read access is not properly restricted, then attackers can steal the sensitive information.
                        If write access is not properly restricted, then attackers can modify and possibly delete the
                        data, causing incorrect results and possibly a denial of service.
