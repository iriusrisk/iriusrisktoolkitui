<threat ref='CAPEC-157-SWARM' name='Attackers get sensitive data from docker swarm through sniffing the transmisions between components' state='Expose' source='MANUAL' owner='' library=''>
              <desc>An attacker monitors information transmitted between logical or physical nodes of a
                                network. The attacker need not be able to prevent reception or change content but must
                                simply be able to observe and read the traffic. The attacker might precipitate or
                                indirectly influence the content of the observed transaction, but the attacker is never
                                the intended recipient of the information. Any transmission medium can theoretically be
                                sniffed if the attacker can listen to the contents between the sender and recipient.
