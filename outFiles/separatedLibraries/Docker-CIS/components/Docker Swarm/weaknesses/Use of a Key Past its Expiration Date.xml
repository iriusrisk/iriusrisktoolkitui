<weakness ref='CWE-324' name='Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date' state='0' impact='100'>
          <desc>The product uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which diminishes
                        its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key.
                        While the expiration of keys does not necessarily ensure that they are compromised, it is a
                        significant concern that keys which remain in use for prolonged periods of time have a
                        decreasing probability of integrity. For this reason, it is important to replace keys within a
                        period of time proportional to their strength.
