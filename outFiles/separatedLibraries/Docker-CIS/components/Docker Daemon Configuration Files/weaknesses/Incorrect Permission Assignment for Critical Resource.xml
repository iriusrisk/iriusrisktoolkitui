<weakness ref='CWE-732' name='Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource' state='0' impact='100'>
          <desc>The software specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution or sensitive user data.  </desc>
