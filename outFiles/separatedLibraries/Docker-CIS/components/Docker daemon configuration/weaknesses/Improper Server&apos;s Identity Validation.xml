<weakness ref='CWE-287' name='Improper Server&apos;s Identity Validation' state='0' impact='100'>
          <desc>The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, the server's identity.
                        If the server's identity is not validated, an attacker could spoof a trusted entity by using a
                        man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The software might connect to a malicious host while believing
                        it is a trusted host, or the software might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears
                        to originate from a trusted host.

                        One way to perform server's authentication is by using X509 certificates over TLS.
