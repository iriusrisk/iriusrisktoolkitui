<weakness ref='CWE-250' name='Execution with Unnecessary Privileges' state='0' impact='100'>
          <desc>The software performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level
                        required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.

                        New weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or
                        Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or
                        surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if
                        they occur while operating at raised privileges. Privilege management functions can behave in
                        some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These
                        inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to
                        another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if
                        a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal
                        handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.
