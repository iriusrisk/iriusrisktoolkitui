<weakness ref='CWE-778' name='Insufficient Logging' state='0' impact='100'>
          <desc>When a security-critical event occurs, the software either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it.

When security-critical events are not logged properly, such as a failed login attempt, this can make malicious behavior more difficult to detect and may hinder forensic analysis after an attack succeeds.  </desc>
