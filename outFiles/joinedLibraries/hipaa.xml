            <steps>	&lt;p&gt;Review if logs can be used for more than extraction of usage statistics of files in the web servers (which is typically what most log-based application will focus on), but also to determine if attacks take place on the web server. &lt;/p&gt;





 In order to analyze web server attacks the error log files of the server need to be analyzed. Review should concentrate on: 



 * 40x (not found) error messages. A large amount of these from the same source might be indicative of a CGI scanner tool being used against the web server. 
 * 50x (server error) messages. These can be an indication of an attacker abusing parts of the application which fail unexpectedly. For example, the first phases of a SQL injection attack will produce these error message when the SQL query is not properly constructed and its execution fails on the back end database. 



 Log statistics or analysis should not be generated, nor stored, in the same server that produces the logs. Otherwise, an attacker might, through a web server vulnerability or improper configuration, gain access to them and retrieve similar information as would be disclosed by log files themselves.</steps>

&lt;p&gt;The creation and modification of a password, should be secure and the new password should comply with minimum security requirements. For example, when the password is changed, the system should request the old password. Another example is the new password is at least a minimum number of characters and at least one number, plus one uppercase character and one lowercase character.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>

            <steps>	&lt;p&gt;How to Test: &lt;/p&gt;


 What characters are permitted and forbidden for use within a password? Is the user required to use characters from different character sets such as lower and uppercase letters, digits and special symbols? 


 How often can a user change their password? How quickly can a user change their password after a previous change? Users may bypass password history requirements by changing their password 5 times in a row so that after the last password change they have configured their initial password again. 


 When must a user change their password? After 90 days? After account lockout due to excessive log on attempts? 


 How often can a user reuse a password? Does the application maintain a history of the user&amp;#8217;s previous used 8 passwords? 


 How different must the next password be from the last password? 


 Is the user prevented from using his username or other account information (such as first or last name) in the password?</steps>

          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Assign an unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; User identification is a way to identify a specific user of an information system, typically by name and/or number. A unique user identifier allows an entity to track specific user activity when that user is logged into an information system. It enables an entity to hold users accountable for functions performed on information systems with EPHI when logged into those systems.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; A single format for user identification is not described or provided. Covered entities must determine the best user identification strategy based on their workforce and operations. Some organizations may use the employee name or a variation of the name (e.g. jsmith). However, other organizations may choose an alternative such as assignment of a set of random numbers and characters. A randomly assigned user identifier is more difficult for an unauthorized user (e.g., a hacker) to guess, but may also be more difficult for authorized users to remember its decision. Regardless of the format, no one other than the user needs to remember the user identifier.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>

&lt;p&gt; Termination procedures must be implemented to remove access privileges when an employee, contractor, or other individual previously entitled to access information no longer has these privileges. Whether the employee leaves the organization voluntarily or involuntarily, procedures to terminate access must be in place.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; The same process that is implemented for termination should also be used to change access levels if an employee's job description changes to require more or less access to EPHI. The procedures should also address the complexity of the organization and the sophistication of associated information systems.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>

          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Create a retrievable, exact copy of electronic protected health information, when needed, before movement of equipment.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This specification protects the availability of EPHI and is similar to the Data Backup Plan implementation specification for the contingency plan standard of the Administrative Safeguards, which requires covered entities to implement procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of EPHI. Therefore, both implementation specifications may be included in the same policies and procedures. A covered entity may choose to backup a hard drive before moving to prevent loss of EPHI when the existing data backup plan does not provide for local hard drive backups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another option may be to limit where computer users store their files. For example, larger organizations may implement policies that require users to save all information on the network, thus eliminating the need for a hard drive back up prior to the move. Either of these options, and others, may be considered reasonable and appropriate solutions, depending on the covered entity’s environment.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>

A covered entity may change its policies and procedures at any time, provided that the changes are documented and are implemented in accordance with this subpart.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;	While this standard requires covered entities to implement policies and procedures, the Security Rule does not define either policy or procedure. Generally, policies define an organization&amp;#8217;s approach. For example, most business policies establish measurable objectives and expectations for the workforce, assign responsibility for decision-making, and define enforcement and consequences for violations. Procedures describe how the organization carries out that approach, setting forth explicit, step-by-step instructions that implement the organization&amp;#8217;s policies.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;	Policies and procedures should reflect the mission and culture of the organization; thus, the security rule enables each covered entity to use current standard business practices for policy development and implementation. Policies and procedures required by the security Rule may be modified as necessary to meet the changing needs of the organization, as long as the changes are documented and implemented in accordance with the Security Rule.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>

&lt;p&gt; User identification is a way to identify a specific user of an information system, typically by name and/or number. A unique user identifier allows an entity to track specific user activity when that user is logged into an information system. It enables an entity to hold users accountable for functions performed on information systems with EPHI when logged into those systems.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; A single format for user identification is not described or provided. Covered entities must determine the best user identification strategy based on their workforce and operations. Some organizations may use the employee name or a variation of the name (e.g. jsmith). However, other organizations may choose an alternative such as assignment of a set of random numbers and characters. A randomly assigned user identifier is more difficult for an unauthorized user (e.g., a hacker) to guess, but may also be more difficult for authorized users to remember its decision. Regardless of the format, no one other than the user needs to remember the user identifier.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>

          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Malicious software can be thought of as any program that harms information systems, such as: viruses, Trojan horses or worms. As a result of an unauthorized infiltration, EPHI and other data can be damaged or destroyed, or at minimum, require expensive and time-consuming repairs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To solve this risk, implement procedures for guarding against, detecting and reporting, found malicious software in our systems. All workforce members must be regularly trained and reminded about this process.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>

          <desc>&lt;p&gt;Implement procedures for periodic testing and revision of contingency plans.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is important to point out that this implementation specification applies to all implementation specifications under the Contingency Plan standard, including the Data Backup Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, and Emergency Mode Operations Plan.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Disaster recovery and emergency mode operations plans might be tested by using a scenario-based walkthrough (to avoid daily operations impacts) or by performing complete live tests. The comprehensiveness and sophistication of the testing and revision procedures depends on the complexity of the covered entity's organization and other factors such as size and costs. It is expected that the frequency and comprehensiveness of the procedures will vary among covered entities.&lt;/p&gt;</desc>
