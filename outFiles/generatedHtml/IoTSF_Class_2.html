<p>All data received should be considered tainted and a potential risk, regardless of the source or transport method. For example, while hidden form fields, cookies, or other headers may be obfuscated from a user, along with parameters passed in ViewStates or other encapsulated forms, these can be modified by the user at the client-side in memory, or in transit on the network. Similarly, data passed from binary or compiled components can be modified in situ or in transit. 
 <i></i> 
 <i>Furthermore, encryption only secures the data in transit between the two ends of the encrypted tunnel (one end of which is typically controlled by the client); data passing through the link may still be malicious.</i> </p>

 As such, all data from the client side must be subjected to strict validation, sanitization, and encoding against expected syntactic and semantic criteria. 
 – Define a specification of the data that is expected at each input; both the syntax (e.g. alphanumeric only) and semantics (e.g. a word of between 1 and 25 characters, or a specific list). As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."
 – Implement a ‘known good’ or white-list approach, where only inputs that meet the strict criteria for each input are accepted, and reject, transform, or encapsulate any non-compliant data.
 – While useful for identifying malicious content, do not rely on looking for specific malformed or attack payloads (blacklists). It is almost impossible to maintain a comprehensive and accurate blacklist due to the complexity and evolving nature of attacks, opportunities to obfuscate payloads, and changes to the code’s execution environment. As noted, blacklists can be useful for detecting and logging potential attacks, or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.
 – Validate all data received from the client, including values such as <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers and cookie values if these are used as input on the server side, X- headers, and other platform specific data objects passed between the client and server.</body></html></div></div>

<p>All data received from the client-side should be considered tainted and a potential risk. If handled properly at the point of input, this untrusted tainted data should have been sanitized and encoded safely. The context when returning the data to the user is important, however, as this will affect what metacharacters have significance, and how they will be interpreted at the client-side. </p>

 For example, if data is inserted into the <span class="caps">HTML</span> body then <span class="caps">HTML</span> Entity encoding should be performed, but if the data is inserted into a JavaScript block, then JavaScript escaping should be performed. Similarly, while JavaScript code should not be executed in the browser when returned in an application/json response, it may then be rendered in an unsafe manner. 
 – Apply contextual encoding to all tainted data when returned to the users (including secondary users if the application has multiple interfaces – e.g. an internal user viewing data entered by an external customer).
 – This should be in addition to, and in conjunction with, sanitization and encoding applied at the time of data acquisition.</body></html></div></div>

<p>User sessions that remain active for extended periods can expose them to attacks, or provide greater opportunities for a malicious actor to exploit a compromised session. For example, cryptographic or brute-force attacks against a session ID may become practical in a longer time-window. Similarly, if a user session has been compromised, an attacker may forcibly keep that session alive to maintain a foothold in the application or environment. These types of attack can be mitigated by setting a hard limit on user sessions, even where the user is (or appears to be) actively using the application. </p> 
<p>Invalidate all user sessions with the application after an extended period, even when they appear active (e.g. after 24 hours the user should be warned to complete their tasks or forced to re-authenticate) </p> 
<p>Ensure session revocation is enforced at the server-side rather than the client-side; for example, the session ID should be invalidated at the server rather than the client-side cookie being deleted or changed.</p>

<p>Applications protecting sensitive or otherwise restricted resources must ensure only appropriate and authorized users may access the application data. It is important that an application prevents unauthorised users gaining inappropriate access to each other’s data; although user A and user B may both be trusted to access data within the application, they may be authorized to only access different subsets of the protected resources. E.g. user A should not be able to access user B’s personal data by manipulating a request (typical examples are manipulation of an ID value or other object reference sent in the <span class="caps">URL</span> or body of an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request). </p> It is not sufficient to rely on obscurity, for example obfuscated or secret 
<span class="caps">URL</span>s or filenames. The application must validate each request for protected data against the proven identity of the user. Before providing access to restricted resources the application must:  
<div> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Ensure the user has undergone appropriate authentication (identification and verification, or ID&amp;V). E.g. they must have provided their identity and confirmed this with a password, token, or other verification.

<p>Where passwords are entered on a web user interface, the actual pass phrase is obscured by default to prevent the capture of passwords.</p>

	<p>Rationale:<br>
Password masking is the practice of obscuring the password characters when entered on a user interface, more often behind bullets (•), asterisks (*) or similar camouflaging characters. The idea behind password masking is primarily the protection against “shoulder surfing”, in other words to prevent nearby observers reading the password “over the user’s shoulder” and thus stolen, which is crucial for mobile devices. A second reason is to obscure the password in cases of shared screens, projectors, etc.</p>

Ensure that the actual pass phrase is obscured by default where entered on a web user interface.</p>

 – aggregation or K-anonymity
 – L-diversity
 – differential privacy
 – hashing or tokenization
 – dummy data
 If anonymization/pseudonymization is not possible, other security controls should be implemented, such as: – strong logical access control to test environment
 – deletion of test environment data after tests have been conducted</p></body></html></div></div>

<p>The trusted execution environment, or <span class="caps">TEE</span>, is an isolated area on the main processor of a device that is separate from the main operating system.

<p>Monolithic kernels are large in size and the structure – or lack of structure – makes them difficult to change and maintain without affecting other parts of the kernel. The microkernel approach is based on the idea of only placing essential core real-time operating system functions in the kernel, and other functionality is designed in modules that communicate through the kernel via minimal well-defined interfaces. The microkernel approach results in easy reconfigurable systems without the need to rebuild the kernel.</p>

	<p>Modern mainstream operating systems (OSes) are designed for functionality, speed and ease of development. With the increase of functionality and support for more diverse hardware, their size and complexity keeps growing. These OSes have a monolithic structure, with most services contained in the kernel, i.e. the part of the system that executes in the privileged mode of the hardware. The result is an explosive growth in the amount of privileged code.</p>

	<p>Any code executing in privileged mode can bypass security, and is therefore inherently part of a system’s trusted computing base (<span class="caps">TCB</span>). Hence we are experiencing a rapid growth of the <span class="caps">TCB</span> of mainstream OSes. As almost all code is buggy, and the number of bugs grows with the size of the code base, this <span class="caps">TCB</span> growth is bound to lead to a growth in the number of vulnerabilities.</p>

	<p>Microkernel design, with its ability to reduce <span class="caps">TCB</span> size, contain faults and encapsulate untrusted components, is, in terms of security, superior to monolithic systems.</p>

	<p>Examples of microkernel architecture are: Mach, L4, <span class="caps">QNX</span>, <span class="caps">MINIX</span>, <span class="caps">IBM</span> K42.</p>

<p>As far as reasonably possible, devices should remain operating and locally functional in the case of a loss of network connection and should recover cleanly in the case of restoration of a loss of power. Devices should be able to return to a network in a sensible state and in an orderly fashion, rather than in a massive scale reconnect.</p>

	<p>Continuous operation ensures that devices provide basic functionality without relying on other systems or networks. It is important to note here that a device should only be required to supply basic features when the network is inaccessible. Devices should provide continuous operation if the network or the Internet is inaccessible. Manual controls where needed, either physical buttons – or digital – on the device itself.</p>

<p>A number of attacks rely on brute-force techniques to send large volumes of requests to enumerate or attempt to exploit flaws in an application, for example, sending common passwords to multiple target accounts within an application.

<ul> 
 <li>Connection rate-limiting based on the source IP address can be used to restrict attacks against the authentication or registration systems. Multiple failures (or attempts) from a single IP should result in temporarily blocking or dropping traffic from the source. Note however that some corporate and <span class="caps">ISP</span> environment may place multiple valid and discrete clients behind the same IP address, resulting in false-positives. </li> 
 <li>Attackers may use botnets and other IP masking techniques to deliver attacks from multiple sources to avoid IP based rate-limiting. To mitigate this class of attack, Indicators of Compromise should be monitored (for example a higher rate of login failures than usual), and appropriate actions taken. For example, when the application detects active brute-force attacks, a Web Application Firewall (<span class="caps">WAF</span>) or other intermediate devices could be used to block attacks sharing a signature from pattern matching or deep packet inspection (e.g. <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers or common passwords across multiple accounts).

<p>To protect users passwords from accidental or deliberate exposure, the application should store cryptographic hashes of passwords instead of the passwords themselves. </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Do not store passwords themselves in the data store for verification at login. </li> 
 <li>Instead, create a cryptographic hash of the password using a strong hash function that includes a work factor and a built in ‘salt’ value, like bcrypt or scrypt. This reduces the risk of brute-force attacks and rainbow tables, and allows flexibility to adapt the hashing function to balance security and performance. </li> 
 <li>Alternatively, use a strong hash function like <span class="caps">SHA</span>-384 together with a unique ‘salt’ value for every account. Apply multiple iterations of the hash to create the additional computational work required to mitigate brute-force attacks.</li>

<p>Applications protecting sensitive or otherwise restricted resources must ensure only appropriate and authorized users may access the application data. It is important that an application prevents unauthorised users gaining inappropriate access to each other’s data; although user A and user B may both be trusted to access data within the application, they may be authorized to only access different subsets of the protected resources. E.g. user A should not be able to access user B’s personal data by manipulating a request (typical examples are manipulation of an ID value or other object reference sent in the <span class="caps">URL</span> or body of an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request). </p> It is not sufficient to rely on obscurity, for example obfuscated or secret 
<span class="caps">URL</span>s or filenames. The application must validate each request for protected data against the proven identity of the user. Before providing access to restricted resources the application must:  
<div> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Ensure the user has undergone appropriate authentication (identification and verification, or ID&amp;V). E.g. they must have provided their identity and confirmed this with a password, token, or other verification. Typically this will be through checking the validity of the session token issued after login. </li> 
  <li>Confirm the user is entitled to access the data or resource they are requesting. E.g. their confirmed identify checked against a server-side access control matrix to determine whether they may access the requested resource. </li> 
  <li>Access controls should be granular, and allow for access to individual resources to be issued to individual users or roles. <span class="caps">URL</span> and asset based access control is provided by most web-frameworks, and it is preferable to use an established and proven framework.</li>

<p>There is a secure method of key insertion that protects keys against copying.</p> 
<p><b><font size="4">Rationale:<br></font></b> Keys should be protected from copying, using a secure insertion method. This can be achieved by using a dedicated secure and trusted hardware module which stores and protects the keys.</p> 
<p><b><font size="4">Remediation:<br></font></b> Trusted Platform Module (<span class="caps">TPM</span>, also known as <span class="caps">ISO</span>/IEC 11889) is an international standard for a secure cryptoprocessor, a dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys. Each <span class="caps">TPM</span> chip has a unique and secret <span class="caps">RSA</span> key burned in as it is produced. Pushing the security down to the hardware level provides more protection than a software-only solution.</p>
