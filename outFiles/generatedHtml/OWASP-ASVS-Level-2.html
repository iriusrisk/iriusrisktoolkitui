<div>
                        HPKP is a Trust on First Use (TOFU) technique. The first time a web server tells a client via a
                        special HTTP header which public keys belong to it, the client stores this information for a
                        given period of time. When the client visits the server again, it expects at least one
                        certificate in the certificate chain to contain a public key whose fingerprint is already known
                        via HPKP. If the server delivers an unknown public key, the client should present a warning to
                        the user.

                        <li>To ensure the authenticity of a server's public key used in TLS sessions, this public
                        key is wrapped into a X.509 certificate which is usually signed by a certificate authority (CA).
                        Web clients such as browsers trust a lot of these CAs, which can all create certificates for
                        arbitrary domain names. If an attacker is able to compromise a single CA, they can perform MITM
                        attacks on various TLS connections. HPKP can circumvent this threat for the HTTPS protocol by
                        telling the client which public key belongs to a certain web server. </li>

                        HTTP offers a number of methods that can be used to perform actions on the web server. Many of
                        theses methods are designed to aid developers in deploying and testing HTTP applications. These
                        HTTP methods can be used for nefarious purposes if the web server is misconfigured.
                        Additionally, Cross Site Tracing (XST), a form of cross site scripting using the server's HTTP
                        TRACE method, is examined.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <br>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        While GET and POST are by far the most common methods that are used to access information
                        provided by a web server, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows several other (and
                        somewhat less known) methods. RFC 2616 (which describes HTTP version 1.1 which is the standard
                        today) defines the following eight methods:
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <ul>
                        <li>HEAD</li>
                        <li>GET</li>
                        <li>POST</li>
                        <li>PUT</li>
                        <li>DELETE</li>
                        <li>TRACE</li>
                        <li>OPTIONS</li>
                        <li>CONNECT</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <br>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        Some of these methods can potentially pose a security risk for a web application, as they allow
                        an attacker to modify the files stored on the web server and, in some scenarios, steal the
                        credentials of legitimate users. More specifically, the methods that should be disabled are the
                        following:
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <ul>
                        <li>
<b>PUT: </b>This method allows a client to upload new files on the web
                        server. An attacker can exploit it by uploading malicious files (e.g.: an asp file that executes
                        commands by invoking cmd.exe), or by simply using the victim's server as a file repository.</li>
                        <li>
<b>DELETE:</b> This method allows a client to delete a file on the web
                        server. An attacker can exploit it as a very simple and direct way to deface a web site or to
                        mount a DoS attack.</li>
                        <li>
<b>CONNECT: </b>This method could allow a client to use the web server as
                        a proxy.</li>
                        <li>
<b>TRACE: </b>This method simply echoes back to the client whatever string
                        has been sent to the server, and is used mainly for debugging purposes. This method, originally
                        assumed harmless, can be used to mount an attack known as Cross Site Tracing, which has been
                        discovered by Jeremiah Grossman (see links at the bottom of the page).</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        If an application needs one or more of these methods, such as REST Web Services (which may
                        require PUT or DELETE), it is important to check that their usage is properly limited to trusted
                        users and safe conditions.
                        </div>

                        <div>
                        Ensure that the application accepts only the HTTP requests GET and POST. The HTTP requests
                        TRACE, PUT and DELETE are blocked.

                        AJAX requests used to pass data between the client- and server- can contain any data, including
                        malicious executable content. This data must be parsed in a safe manner to prevent malicious
                        code being executed to compromise the application or it's users. Utilizing eval based solutions
                        to process input data places the application at risk, as the malicious user has control over the
                        data passed to the eval function, and could execute arbitrary code as a result. JSON.parse
                        provides a means to convert the JSON payloads into an object without risk of execution.

<div id="collapse55" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="heading55" data-parent="#parent50"><div class="card-body"><html><body>
<p>All data received should be considered tainted and a potential risk, regardless of the source or transport method. For example, while hidden form fields, cookies, or other headers may be obfuscated from a user, along with parameters passed in ViewStates or other encapsulated forms, these can be modified by the user at the client-side in memory, or in transit on the network. Similarly, data passed from binary or compiled components can be modified in situ or in transit. 
 <i></i> 
 <i>Furthermore, encryption only secures the data in transit between the two ends of the encrypted tunnel (one end of which is typically controlled by the client); data passing through the link may still be malicious.</i> </p>

 As such, all data from the client side must be subjected to strict validation, sanitization, and encoding against expected syntactic and semantic criteria. 
 - Define a specification of the data that is expected at each input; both the syntax (e.g. alphanumeric only) and semantics (e.g. a word of between 1 and 25 characters, or a specific list). As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."
 - Implement a 'known good' or white-list approach, where only inputs that meet the strict criteria for each input are accepted, and reject, transform, or encapsulate any non-compliant data.
 - While useful for identifying malicious content, do not rely on looking for specific malformed or attack payloads (blacklists). It is almost impossible to maintain a comprehensive and accurate blacklist due to the complexity and evolving nature of attacks, opportunities to obfuscate payloads, and changes to the code's execution environment. As noted, blacklists can be useful for detecting and logging potential attacks, or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.
 - Validate all data received from the client, including values such as <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers and cookie values if these are used as input on the server side, X- headers, and other platform specific data objects passed between the client and server.</body></html></div></div>

                        Error messages can reveal information of use to an attacker. Explicit errors from the reset or

                        an attacker in enumerating usernames for subsequent attack. Even small variations in errors
                        returned to the user can be used to infer how the application operates, or enforces security

                        Enumeration of usernames and/or email addresses within an application is a common attack, aiding
                        in conducting brute-force attacks against users, and with potential privacy issues where the
                        username is considered to be personally identifiable information (PII).

                        Single or automated sign-on from thick client applications can be facilitated in a number of
                        ways; local/client-side storage of credentials is considered an insecure option due to the risk
                        of exposure of the credentials at the client-side.

                        <li>If possible, avoid storing authentication credentials on the client at all. Instead,
                        consider use of keys, certificates, or other cryptographically secure token unique to the
                        client-side instance and controlled by the client-side.  For example, a unique key
                        could be issued to each client where the 'stay logged in' or similar function has been selected.
                        These individual keys can then be expired or revoked from the server-side automatically or by
                        the user as required.</li>
                        <li>If credentials must be stored, then they should be stored in a cryptographically

                        <li>Where possible, system provided stores should be used; for example, iOS and Android
                        provide password stores, as does MacOS/OS X's Keychain.</li>

                        to multiple target accounts within an application. By profiling normal traffic volumes, and

                        additional assurance, they should not be considered a true secret, or of equal security to the
                        user's password. Furthermore, it is important that laws and legislation around private and
                        personally identifiable information (PII) are observed, and the risk of disclosure of the

  The application should ensure users have undergone an Identification and Verification (ID&amp;V) process before allowing access to secret, sensitive or otherwise restricted data. For more sensitive applications hosting data or functionality requiring greater assurance over the identification of users, a multi- or two-factor authentication process is recommended. Together with asserting their identity and a password/phrase/PIN (something you know), such systems require additional factors, such as biometric validation (something you are) or a token (something you have).

                        Users must retain control of their credentials in a single factor system, and to facilitate this
                        they must have the ability to change their password. This is particularly important should the
                        user determine their password has been compromised, potentially allowing a third party to access
                        the system impersonating them. Furthermore, accountability is adversely affected where users
                        cannot change their passwords, as they can plausibly claim that even though they knew their
                        account credentials were compromised, there was no way for them to prevent unauthorized use of
                        the account.

                        User sessions that remain active for extended periods can expose them to attacks, or provide

                        The session token value issued after users have successfully identified and authenticated
                        themselves is of equivalent value to the secrets the user presents to login, and must be
                        protected accordingly. Data passed in the URL (address bar) between client and server is likely
                        to be exposed in logs on the server, or intermediate devices (such as proxies or other network

                        SessionID value as a parameter in the URL of a get request between hosts. To mitigate the risk
                        of exposure of sensitive data, it should only be sent in the body of an HTTP message (for

                        Applications protecting sensitive or otherwise restricted resources must ensure only appropriate
                        and authorized users may access the application data. It is important that an application
                        prevents unauthorized users gaining inappropriate access to each other's data; although user A
                        and user B may both be trusted to access data within the application, they may be authorized to
                        only access different subsets of the protected resources.  E.g. user A should not be
                        able to access user B's personal data by manipulating a request (typical examples are
                        manipulation of an ID value or other object reference sent in the URL or body of an HTTP
                        request).

                        It is not sufficient to rely on obscurity, for example obfuscated or secret URLs or filenames.
                        The application must validate each request for protected data against the proven identity of the
                        user. Before providing access to restricted resources the application must:
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Ensure the user has undergone appropriate authentication (identification and
                        verification, or ID&amp;V). E.g. they must have provided their identity and confirmed this
                        with a password, token, or other verification. Typically this will be through checking the
                        validity of the session token issued after login.</li>
                        <li>Confirm the user is entitled to access the data or resource they are requesting. E.g.
                        their confirmed identify checked against a server-side access control matrix to determine
                        whether they may access the requested resource.</li>
                        <li>Access controls should be granular, and allow for access to individual resources to be
                        issued to individual users or roles.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div>
                        URL and asset based access control is provided by most web-frameworks, and it is preferable to
                        use an established and proven framework.

                        Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks exploit users by causing them to unknowingly submit

<p>A number of attacks rely on brute-force techniques to send large volumes of requests to enumerate or attempt to exploit flaws in an application, for example, sending common passwords to multiple target accounts within an application. By profiling normal traffic volumes, and applying rate limiting, the application can be built to actively mitigate such attacks.</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Connection rate-limiting based on the source IP address can be used to restrict attacks against the authentication or registration systems. Multiple failures (or attempts) from a single IP should result in temporarily blocking or dropping traffic from the source. Note however that some corporate and <span class="caps">ISP</span> environment may place multiple valid and discrete clients behind the same IP address, resulting in false-positives. </li> 
 <li>Attackers may use botnets and other IP masking techniques to deliver attacks from multiple sources to avoid IP based rate-limiting. To mitigate this class of attack, Indicators of Compromise should be monitored (for example a higher rate of login failures than usual), and appropriate actions taken. For example, when the application detects active brute-force attacks, a Web Application Firewall (<span class="caps">WAF</span>) or other intermediate devices could be used to block attacks sharing a signature from pattern matching or deep packet inspection (e.g. <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers or common passwords across multiple accounts). Similarly, the application could respond by requiring a <span class="caps">CAPTCHA</span>, cookie, or Javascript challenge when an attack is detected.</li>

                        All data received from the client-side should be considered tainted and a potential risk,
                        regardless of the source or transport method. Many flaws in applications result from unsafe
                        handling of filenames or path data, for example directory traversal and arbitrary file
                        disclosure. Use of filenames or other direct references to objects such as files at the

                        Database injection attacks, such as SQLi (SQL Injection) rely on sending tainted client-side
                        data which is used in dynamic SQL queries at the server-side in an unsafe manner. For example,
                        creating queries by concatenating strings using untrusted data may result in vulnerable
                        code
                        <b>,</b> for example an attacker may append an 'OR' statement through the
                        provided customerName parameter passed to the following code to bypass the checks and return
                        additional data from the database:
                        </div>

 - This should be in addition to, and in conjunction with, sanitization and encoding applied at the time of data acquisition.</body></html></div></div>

                        A number of significant attacks rely on accessing sensitive data in the memory of targeted

                        To protect against padding oracles, you want to make sure that your application does not return
                        a different error when the padding is wrong. The best way to do this is an Encrypt-then-MAC
                        construction, where a Message Authentication Code (MAC) is applied to the ciphertext. If the MAC
                        fails, you don't even need to look at the padding. If the MAC is correct, it is
                        cryptographically unlikely that the padding has been tampered with.

                        best-practice, or application security expectations. The application should attempt to mitigate
                        this risk by requesting the browser does not cache or store sensitive data such as credit card
                        PANs and CV2s, personally identifiable information (PII) or other secret data.

                        A number of significant attacks rely on accessing sensitive data in the memory of targeted
                        servers and end-user systems. Attacks typically require physical or local access, but remote
                        instances such as the Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL were exploitable remotely. The vulnerability
                        exists as memory occupied by sensitive data is not overwritten when freed, which allows an
                        attacker to subsequently inspect the memory used by the process, or read data through an
                        uninitialized variable to gain access to the sensitive data.

                        Data passed in the URL (address bar) between client and server is likely to be exposed in logs

                        Browsers and extensions provide a number of local storage options to persist data during HTTP
                        interactions, including (but not limited to) Cookies, HTML5 local storage, session storage,
                        IndexedDB, Flash! cookies, and Silverlight isolated storage. These storage options may all be
                        accessed by subsequent users of the browser or computer, and some have experienced security
                        vulnerabilities providing unauthorized and/or remote access to their contents. It is important
                        that sensitive, private, and otherwise restricted data is handled with care at the client-side,
                        and is not stored in insecure locations which may expose it to attack.
