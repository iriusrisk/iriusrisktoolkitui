:abstract: This document is an introduction and tutorial to the use
    of ``generateDS.py`` which generates Python data structures (for
    example, class definitions) from an XML schema document.  These
    data structures represent the elements in an XML document
    described by the XML schema. It also generates parsers that
    load an XML document into those data structures. In addition,
    a separate file containing subclasses (stubs) is optionally
    generated. The user can add methods to the subclasses in order
    to process the contents of an XML document.
