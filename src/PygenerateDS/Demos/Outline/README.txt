Outline -- a demo for generateDS.py
=====================================

This directory contains a small example of the use of `generateDS.py`.
It demonstrates the use of a generated subclass file to add extended
behavior to the code generated by `generateDS.py`.  It contains the
following:

- outline.xsd -- The XML Schema file used to generate Python data
  representation classes.

- outline.py -- This file was generated by using the "-o" command
  line option for `generateDS.py`.

	  python ../../generateDS.py -o outline.py outline.xsd

- outline_extended.py -- This file was produced by generating a
  subclass file.  See use of "-s" and "--super" command line
  options, above.  Then we add methods that show the outline in a
  brief format.  The file was originally produced with the following
  command, *but* you might want to save the extensions in that file
  before regenerating it:

	  python ../../generateDS.py -o outline.py -s outline_extended.py --super="outline" outline.xsd

- outline.xml -- A sample data file used to test the generated
  Python code.  Run either of the following:

    python outline.py outline.xml
    python outline_extended.py outline.xml
